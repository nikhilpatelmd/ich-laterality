  abstract = {The application of machine learning (ML) to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can quantify and improve misallocation in healthcare. We study the decision to prescribe anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation patients; anticoagulation reduces stroke risk but increases hemorrhage risk. We combine observational data on treatment choice and guideline use with ML estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects from eight RCTs. When physicians adopt a clinical guideline, treatment decisions shift towards the recommendation but adherence remains far from perfect. Improving guideline adherence would produce larger gains than informing physicians about guidelines. Adherence to an optimal rule would prevent 47\% more strokes without increasing hemorrhages.},

Despite the popularity of this and related axioms, there is no operationalized definition of a common disease, and no practicable way of incorporating actual disease frequencies into differential diagnosis. In this essay, we aim to disambiguate the definition of a common (or rare) disease and show that incidence\textemdash not prevalence\textemdash is the proper metric of disease frequency for differential diagnosis. We explore how numerical estimates of disease frequencies based on incidence can be incorporated into differential diagnosis as well as the inherent limitations of this method. These concepts have important implications for diagnostic decision making and medical education, and hold promise as a method to improve diagnostic accuracy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Noninferiority trials are increasingly common, though they have less standardized designs and their interpretation is less familiar to clinicians than superiority trials. OBJECTIVE: To empirically evaluate a cohort of noninferiority trials to determine 1) their interpretation as recommended by CONSORT, 2) choice of alpha threshold and its sidedness, and 3) differences between methods of analysis such as intention-to-treat and per-protocol. DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE for parallel-group randomized controlled noninferiority trials published in the five highest-impact general medical journals between 2011 and 2016. MAIN MEASURES: Data abstracted included trial design parameters, results, and interpretation of results based on CONSORT recommendations. KEY RESULTS: One hundred sixty-three trials and 182 noninferiority comparisons were included in our analysis. Based on CONSORT-recommended interpretation, 79\% of experimental therapies met criteria for noninferiority, 13\% met criteria for superiority, 20\% were declared inconclusive, and 2\% met criteria for inferiority. However, for 12\% of trials, the experimental therapy was statistically significantly worse than the active control, but CONSORT recommended an interpretation of inconclusive or noninferior. A two-sided alpha equivalent of greater than 0.05 was used in 34\% of the trials, and in five of these trials, the use of a standard two-sided alpha of 0.05 led to changes in the interpretation of results that disfavored the experimental therapy. In four of the five comparisons where different methods of analysis (e.g., intention-to-treat and per-protocol) yielded different results, the intention-to-treat analysis was the more conservative. In 11\% of trials, a secondary advantage of the new therapy was neither reported nor could it be inferred by reviewers. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, the design and interpretation of noninferiority trials led to significant and systematic bias in favor of the experimental therapy. Clinicians should exercise caution when interpreting these trials. Future trials may be more reliable if design parameters are standardized.},

  abstract = {Rates of survival with functional recovery for both in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are notably low. Extra-corporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is emerging as a modality to improve prognosis by augmenting per-fusion to vital end-organs by utilizing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during conventional CPR and stabilizing the patient for interventions aimed at reversing the aetiology of the arrest. Implementing this emergent procedure requires a substantial investment in resources, and even the most successful ECPR programs may nonethe-less burden healthcare systems, clinicians, patients, and their families with unsalvageable patients supported by extra-corporeal devices. Non-randomized and observational studies have repeatedly shown an association between ECPR and improved survival, versus conventional CPR, for in-hospital cardiac arrest in select patient populations. Recently, randomized controlled trials suggest benefit for ECPR over standard resuscitation, as well as the feasibility of perform-ing such trials, in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest within highly coordinated healthcare delivery systems. Application of these data to clinical practice should be done cautiously, with outcomes likely to vary by the setting and system within which ECPR is initiated. ECPR introduces important ethical challenges, including whether it should be con-sidered an extension of CPR, at what point it becomes sustained organ replacement therapy, and how to approach patients unable to recover or be bridged to heart replacement therapy. The economic impact of ECPR varies by health system, and has the potential to outstrip resources if used indiscriminately. Ideally, studies should include economic evaluations to inform health care systems about the cost-benefits of this therapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: All of Us is a novel research program that aims to accelerate research in populations traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research. Our objective was to evaluate the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in broadly defined underrepresented groups. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the latest data release of All of Us. We conducted a cross-\-sectional analysis combining survey and electronic health record data to estimate the prevalence of CVD upon enrollment in underrepresented groups defined by race, ethnicity, age ({$>$}75 years), disability (not able to carry out everyday physical activities), sexual orientation and gender identity lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA+), income (annual household income {$<\$$}35 000 US dollars) and education (less than a high school degree). We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and product terms to test for interaction. The latest All of Us data release includes 315 297 participants. Of these, 230 577 (73\%) had information on CVD and 17 958 had CVD (overall prevalence, 7.8\%; 95\% CI, 7.7\textendash\- 7.9). Multivariate analyses adjusted by hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, body mass index, and smoking indicated that, compared with White participants, Black participants had a higher adjusted odds of CVD (OR, 1.21; 95\% CI, 1.16\textendash\-1.27). Higher adjusted odds of CVD were also observed in underrepresented groups defined by other factors, including age {$>$}75 years (OR, 1.90; 95\% CI, 1.81\textendash\-1.99), disability (OR, 1.60; 95\% CI, 1.53\textendash\-1.68), and income {$<\$$}35 000 US dollars (OR, 1.22; 95\% CI, 1.17\textendash\-1.27). Sex significantly modified the odds of CVD in several of the evaluated groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among participants enrolled in All of Us, underrepresented groups defined based on race, ethnicity and other factors have a disproportionately high burden of CVD. The All of Us research program constitutes a powerful platform to accelerate research focused on individuals in underrepresented groups.},

The aim of this policy statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence evaluating stroke systems of care to date and to update the American Stroke Association recommendations on the basis of improvements in stroke systems of care. Over the past decade, stroke systems of care have seen vast improvements in endovascular therapy, neurocritical care, and stroke center certification, in addition to the advent of innovations, such as telestroke and mobile stroke units, in the context of significant changes in the organization of healthcare policy in the United States. This statement provides an update to prior publications to help guide policymakers and public healthcare agencies in continually updating their stroke systems of care in light of these changes. This statement and its recommendations span primordial and primary prevention, acute stroke recognition and activation of emergency medical services, triage to appropriate facilities, designation of and treatment at stroke centers, secondary prevention at hospital discharge, and rehabilitation and recovery.}

Methods: PreVent (Preventing Hypoxemia with Manual Ventilation during Endotracheal Intubation) was a multicenter RCT examining the effects of positive-pressure ventilation during tracheal intubation on oxygen saturation and severe hypoxemia. Analysts unaware of PreVent's results used patient-level data from three previous trials evaluating airway management interventions to emulate PreVent's eligibility criteria, randomization procedure, and statistical analysis. After PreVent's release, results of this blinded observational analysis were compared with those of the RCT. Difference-in-differences estimates for comparison of treatment effects between the observational analysis and the PreVent trial are reported on the absolute scale.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Inflammation and oxidative damage caused by severe infections may be attenuated by vitamin C. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of parenteral vitamin C as combined therapy or monotherapy versus no parenteral vitamin C administered to adults hospitalized with severe infection. The primary outcome was mortality. We performed random-effects meta-analyses and assessed certainty in effect estimates. RESULTS Of 1547 citations, 41 RCTs (n 5 4915 patients) were eligible for inclusion. Lowcertainty evidence suggested that vitamin C may reduce in-hospital mortality (21 RCTs, 2762 patients; risk ratio, 0.88 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.73 to 1.06]), 30-day mortality (24 RCTs, 3436 patients; risk ratio, 0.83 [95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.98]), and early mortality (before hospital discharge or 30 days; 34 RCTs, 4366 patients; risk ratio, 0.80 [95\% CI, 0.68 to 0.93]). Effects were attenuated in sensitivity analyses limited to published blinded trials at low risk-of-bias (in-hospital mortality: risk ratio, 1.07 [95\% CI, 0.92 to 1.24], moderate certainty; 30-day mortality: risk ratio, 0.88 [95\% CI, 0.71 to 1.10], low certainty; and early mortality: risk ratio, 0.88 [95\% CI, 0.73 to 1.06], low certainty). For 90-day mortality, all trials had low risk-of-bias; moderate-certainty evidence suggested harm (five RCTs, 1722 patients; risk ratio, 1.07 [95\% CI, 0.94 to 1.21]). Moderatecertainty evidence suggested an increased risk of hypoglycemia (risk ratio, 1.20 [95\% CI, 0.69 to 2.08]). Effects on other secondary outcomes were mixed and informed by lowcertainty evidence. No credible subgroup effects were observed for mortality related to cointerventions (monotherapy vs. combined therapy), dose, or type of infection (Covid-19 vs. other). CONCLUSIONS Overall, evidence from RCTs does not establish a survival benefit for vitamin C in patients with severe infection. (PROSPERO number, CRD42020209187.)},

  abstract = {Magnitude of intracranial pressure (ICP) elevations and their duration have been associated with worse outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injuries (TBI), however published thresholds for injury vary and uncertainty about these levels has received relatively little attention. In this study, we have analyzed high-resolution ICP monitoring data in 227 adult patients in the CENTER-TBI dataset. Our aim was to identify thresholds of ICP intensity and duration associated with worse outcome, and to evaluate the uncertainty in any such thresholds. We present ICP intensity and duration plots to visualize the relationship between ICP events and outcome. We also introduced a novel bootstrap technique to evaluate uncertainty of the equipoise line. We found that an intensity threshold of 18 {$\pm$} 4 mmHg (2 standard deviations) was associated with worse outcomes in this cohort. In contrast, the uncertainty in what duration is associated with harm was larger, and safe durations were found to be population dependent. The pressure and time dose (PTD) was also calculated as area under the curve above thresholds of ICP. A relationship between PTD and mortality could be established, as well as for unfavourable outcome. This relationship remained valid for mortality but not unfavourable outcome after adjusting for IMPACT core variables and maximum therapy intensity level. Importantly, during periods of impaired autoregulation (defined as pressure reactivity index (PRx){$>$}0.3) ICP events were associated with worse outcomes for nearly all durations and ICP levels in this cohort and there was a stronger relationship between outcome and PTD. Whilst caution should be exercised in ascribing causation in observational analyses, these results suggest intracranial hypertension is poorly tolerated in the presence of impaired autoregulation. ICP level guidelines may need to be revised in the future taking into account cerebrovascular autoregulation status considered jointly with ICP levels.},

This review highlights the emerging evidence on critical care nutrition and focuses on the pathophysiologic interplay between critical illness, the gastrointestinal tract, and nutrition support and the evidence on the best route, dose, and timing of nutrition. Although indirect calorimetry is recommended to measure energy expenditure, predictive equations are commonly used but are limited by their inaccuracy in individual patients. The current evidence supports early enteral nutrition (EN) in most patients, with a gradual increase in the daily dose over the first week. Delayed EN is warranted in patients with severe shock. According to recent trials, parenteral nutrition seems to be as effective as EN and may be started if adequate EN is not achieved by the first week of critical illness. A high protein dose has been recommended, but the best timing is unclear. Immuno-nutrition should not be routinely provided to critically ill patients. Patients receiving artificial nutrition should be monitored for metabolic derangements. Additional adequately powered studies are still needed to resolve many unanswered questions.},

The acute treatment of aSAH is well documented but less is known about the long-term effects of aSAH on cognition and day-to-day functioning. METHODS: We reviewed all studies in the past 10 years that have focused on the effects of aSAH on cognition and day-to-day functioning. RESULTS: Sixty-one empirical studies examining cognitive and functional outcome in patients with aSAH met inclusion criteria. Survivors of aSAH commonly experience deficits in memory, executive function, and language. These cognitive impairments interact to affect patients' day-to-day functioning, including activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, return to work, and quality of life. Deficits in cognition and day-to-day functioning are further compounded by depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Much remains to be learned about the brain changes underlying cognitive and functional deficits, including the role of diffuse brain damage and secondary complications like vasospasm and elevated intracranial pressure. A consideration of these issues is necessary to obtain a better understanding of how aSAH affects cognition and day-to-day functioning in the long-term.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose: Historically, overall outcomes for patients with high-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have been poor. Generally, between physicians, either reluctance to treat, or selectivity in treating such patients has been the paradigm. Recent studies have shown that early and aggressive care leads to significant improvement in survival rates and favorable outcomes of grade V SAH patients. With advancements in both neurocritical care and end-of-life care, nontreatment or selective treatment of grade V SAH patients is rarely justified. Current paradigm shifts towards early and aggressive care in such cases may lead to improved outcomes for many more patients. Materials and methods: We performed a detailed review of the current literature regarding neurointensive management strategies in high-grade SAH, discussing multiple aspects. We discussed the neurointensive care management protocols for grade V SAH patients. Results: Acutely, intracranial pressure control is of utmost importance with external ventricular drain placement, sedation, optimization of cerebral perfusion pressure, osmotherapy and hyperventilation, as well as cardiopulmonary support through management of hypotension and hypertension. Conclusions: Advancements of care in SAH patients make it unethical to deny treatment to poor Hunt and Hess grade patients. Early and aggressive treatment results in a significant improvement in survival rate and favorable outcome in such patients.},

  abstract = {Background Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) demonstrated that tocilizumab reduces mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, substantial uncertainty remains whether tocilizumab's effect is similar across clinically relevant subgroups. Whether this uncertainty can be resolved with Bayesian methods is unknown. Design, Setting, Participants, and Interventions RECOVERY was a controlled, open-label, platform UK trial that randomized (1:1) 4116 adults with oxygen saturation {$<$}92\% on room air or receiving oxygen therapy with C-reactive protein {$\geq$}75 mg/L to either usual care or tocilizumab plus usual care. Main outcome measures Mortality and hospital discharge within 28 days. Methods Using Bayesian methods, we combined RECOVERY with evidence-based priors incorporating previous COVID-19 tocilizumab RCTs. The probability of tocilizumab's benefit for respiratory support and corticosteroid subgroups and sensitivity analyses were performed with different prior distributions and baseline risks. Results For all-cause mortality, the posterior probabilities of decreased deaths with tocilizumab were {$>$}99\% and 19\% in patients using and not using corticosteroids, respectively. In patients on simple oxygen only, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, the probabilities of decreased mortality were 96\%, {$>$}99\% and 77\%, respectively. The probabilities for a clinically significant mortality reduction, as assessed by an absolute risk difference {$>$} 3\% (number needed to treat {$\leq$} 33), were 77\%, 96\%, 56\%, respectively. Sensitivity analyses highlighted the uncertainty and lack of conclusive evidence for tocilizumab's effect in patients on invasive mechanical ventilation and those without concurrent corticosteroids. Posterior probabilities of benefit for hospital discharge outcome were high and consistent across most subgroups. Conclusions In this Bayesian reanalysis, COVID-19 hospitalized patients exposed to corticosteroids or on non-invasive ventilation have a high probability of a clinically meaningful mortality benefit from tocilizumab. Tocilizumab also likely improves discharge from hospital in most subgroups. Future research should further address if patients on invasive mechanical ventilation can also benefit from tocilizumab.},

We examined whether commonly used stroke outcome measures captured aspects of QoL. Methods\textemdash{} We examined primary outcomes by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index (BI) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and QoL by Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) and European Quality of Life Scale (EQ-5D) from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA). Using Spearman correlations and logistic regression, we described the relationships between QoL mRS, NIHSS, and BI at 3 months, stratified by respondent (patient or proxy). Using {$\chi$}2 analyses, we examined the mismatch between good primary outcome (mRS {$\leq$}1, NIHSS {$\leq$}5, or BI {$\geq$}95) but poor QoL, and poor primary outcome (mRS {$\geq$}3, NIHSS {$\geq$}20, or BI {$\leq$}60) but good QoL. Results\textemdash{} Patient-assessed QoL had a stronger association with mRS (EQ-5D weighted score n=2987, P{$<$}0.0001, r=-0.7, r2=0.53; SIS recovery n=2970, P{$<$}0.0001, r=-0.71, r2=0.52).

We examined whether differences in index stroke severity, stroke risk factors, mortality, and stroke outcome across geographical locations remain after adjusting for case mix. Methods\textemdash{} We analyzed 3284 patients from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA). We used logistic regression to examine the incidence of mild index stroke, functional, and neurological outcomes after accounting for age, medical history, year of trial recruitment, and initial stroke severity in the functional and neurological outcome analyses. We examined mortality between geographical regions using a Cox proportional hazards model, accounting for age, initial stroke severity, medical history, and year of trial recruitment. Results\textemdash{} Patients enrolled in the USA and Canada had the most severe index strokes. Those recruited in Austria and Switzerland had the best functional and neurological outcomes at 90 days (P{$<$}0.05), whereas those enrolled in Germany had the worst functional outcome at 90 days (P=0.013). Patients enrolled in Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Greece, Israel, Spain, and Portugal had a significantly better survival rate when compared with those enrolled in USA and Canada. Patients enrolled in trials after 1998 had more severe index strokes, with no significant difference in outcome compared with those enrolled before 1998. Conclusion\textemdash{} We identified regional variations in index stroke severity, outcome, and mortality for patients enrolled in ischemic stroke clinical trials over the past 13 years that were not fully explained by case mix.

  abstract = {Over the past decades, electroencephalography (EEG) has become a widely applied and highly sophisticated brain monitoring tool in a variety of intensive care unit (ICU) settings. The most common indication for EEG monitoring currently is the management of refractory status epilepticus. In addition, a number of studies have associated frequent seizures, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), with worsening secondary brain injury and with worse outcomes. With the widespread utilization of EEG (spot and continuous EEG), rhythmic and periodic patterns that do not fulfill strict seizure criteria have been identified, epidemiologically quantified, and linked to pathophysiological events across a wide spectrum of critical and acute illnesses, including acute brain injury. Increasingly, EEG is not just qualitatively described, but also quantitatively analyzed together with other modalities to generate innovative measurements with possible clinical relevance. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge and emerging applications of EEG in the ICU, including seizure detection, ischemia monitoring, detection of cortical spreading depolarizations, assessment of consciousness and prognostication. We also review some technical aspects and challenges of using EEG in the ICU including the logistics of setting up ICU EEG monitoring in resource-limited settings.},

  abstract = {ObjectivesThe goal of our study is to determine optimal criteria which can be used to avoid admission to neuroscience intensive care units for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).Patients and methodsThis is a retrospective cohort study of 431 patients with primary ICH from January 2013 to the end of December 2015 and reviewed multiple admitting characteristics. Based on these needs, we tested the following step-down unit admission criteria: Supratentorial ICH, ICH volume {$<$}20 cc, no Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), systolic BP {$<$}200mmHg, no respiratory failure, GCS{$\geq$}12. We classified 431 patients into two groups; 1-Patients who met step-down unit admission Criteria (71 patients). 2-Patients who didn't meet the criteria (360 patients).ResultsIn our patients, 16.5\% fulfilled the criteria. Length of stay in the ICU was 1.43days in step-down unit admission criteria patients. None of the patients who fulfilled the criteria were readmitted to the ICU, compared to 3 readmissions among the group of patients who did not fulfill the criteria (P=0.82). None of these patients required a neurosurgical procedure vs 47 patients (10.9\%) in the other group (P=0.04). Among patients who met the criteria, 83.1\% were discharged home or rehab RR 0.33 CI (0.19\textendash 0.55), (P{$<$}0.0001).ConclusionWe propose that patients who fulfill step-down unit admission criteria can be safely monitored in stroke unit and they have no need for ICU admission. Further studies are needed to validate these criteria in a prospective manner.},

METHODS: Patients with ICH were included across 121 Florida hospitals participating in the Florida Stroke Registry from 2010 to 2019. We studied the effect of LOC on presentation on in-hospital mortality (primary outcome), WOLST, ambulation status on discharge, hospital length of stay, and discharge disposition. RESULTS: Among 37\,613 cases with ICH (mean age 71, 46\% women, 61\% White, 20\% Black, 15\% Hispanic), 12\,272 (33\%) had impaired LOC at onset. Compared with cases with preserved LOC, patients with impaired LOC were older (72 versus 70 years), more women (49\% versus 45\%), more likely to have aphasia (38\% versus 16\%), had greater ICH score (3 versus 1), greater risk of WOLST (41\% versus 18\%), and had an increased in-hospital mortality (32\% versus 12\%). In the multivariable-logistic regression with generalized estimating equations accounting for basic demographics, comorbidities, ICH severity, hospital size and teaching status, impaired LOC was associated with greater mortality (odds ratio, 3.7 [95\% CI, 3.1\textendash 4.3], P{$<$}0.0001) and less likely discharged home or to rehab (odds ratio, 0.3 [95\% CI, 0.3\textendash 0.4], P{$<$}0.0001). WOLST significantly mediated the effect of impaired LOC on mortality (mediation effect, 190 [95\% CI, 152\textendash 229], P{$<$}0.0001). Early WOLST ({$<$}2 days) occurred among 51\% of patients. A reduction in early WOLST was observed in patients with impaired LOC after the 2015 American Heart Association/ American Stroke Association ICH guidelines recommending aggressive treatment and against early do-not-resuscitate. CONCLUSIONS: In this large multicenter stroke registry, a third of ICH cases presented with impaired LOC. Impaired LOC was associated with greater in-hospital mortality and worse disposition at discharge, largely influenced by early decision to withhold or WOLST.},

Cerebral computed tomography perfusion mean transit times have been proposed as a predictor of vasospasm but suffer from well-\- known technical limitations. We evaluated fully automated, thresholded time-\-to-\-maxima of the tissue residue function (Tmax) for determination of vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective analysis of 540 arterial segments from 36 encounters in 31 consecutive patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage undergoing computed tomography angiography (CTA), computed tomography perfusion, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) within 24 hours. Tmax at 4, 6, 8, and 10 s was generated using RAPID (iSchemaView Inc., Menlo Park, CA). Dual-\-reader CTA and computed tomography perfusion interpretations were compared for patients with and without vasospasm on DSA (DSA+ and DSA-). Logistic regression models were developed using CTA and Tmax as input predictors and DSA vasospasm as outcome in adjusted and unadjusted models. Imaging studies from all 31 subjects (mean age 47.3{$\pm$}11.1, 77\% female, 65\% with single aneurysm with mean size of 6.0{$\pm$}2.9 mm) were included. Vasospasm was identified in 42 segments on DSA and 59 segments on CTA, with significant associations across individual vessel segments (P{$<$}0.001). In adjusted analyses, DSA vasospasm was associated with CTA (odds ratio [OR], 2.43; 95\% CI, 0.94\textendash\-6.32; P=0.068) as well as territory-\-specific Tmax{$>$}6 seconds delays (OR, 3.57; 95\% CI, 1.36\textendash\-9.35; P=0.009). Sensitivity/ specificity for DSA vasospasm was 31\%/91\% for CTA, 26\%/89\% for Tmax{$>$}6 seconds, and 12\%/99\% for CTA+Tmax{$>$}6 seconds. CONCLUSIONS: CTA and Tmax offer high specificity for presence of vasospasm; their utility, even in combination, as screening tests is, however, limited by poor sensitivity.},

For each topic, the members of the writing group identified relevant references and evaluated them as a resource to make the standards summarized herein. Each section was independently reviewed by an expert reviewer who was not part of the task force. Expert reviewers were also permitted to comment on other sections if they chose. Differences of opinion were adjudicated by consensus. The standards presented in this report are intended to serve as a guide for high-quality reporting of statistical analyses methods and results.},

In clinical practice it is helpful to label individuals as having or not having an attribute, such as being ``hypertensive'' or ``obese'' or having ``high cholesterol,'' depending on the value of a continuous variable. Categorisation of continuous variables is also common in clinical research, but here such simplicity is gained at some cost. Though grouping may help data presentation, notably in tables, categorisation is unnecessary for statistical analysis and it has some serious drawbacks. Here we consider the impact of converting continuous data to two groups (dichotomising), as this is the most common approach in clinical research.1 What are the perceived advantages of forcing all individuals into two groups? A common argument is that it greatly simplifies the statistical analysis and leads to easy interpretation and presentation of results. A \ldots},

Randomised controlled clinical trials that do not show a significant difference between the treatments being compared are often called ``negative.'' This term wrongly implies that the study has shown that there is no difference, whereas usually all that has been shown is an absence of evidence of a difference. These are quite different statements.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The role of regional hypoperfusion as a contributor to stroke risk in atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar disease has recently been confirmed by the observational VERiTAS (Vertebrobasilar Flow Evaluation and Risk of Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke) Study. We examined the stability of hemodynamic status over time and its relationship to stroke risk in patients from this prospective cohort. METHODS: VERiTAS enrolled patients with recently symptomatic {$\geq$}50\% atherosclerotic stenosis/occlusion of vertebral and/or basilar arteries. Large vessel flow in the vertebrobasilar territory was assessed using quantitative magnetic resonance angiography, and patients were designated as low or normal flow based on distal territory regional flow, incorporating collateral capacity. Patients underwent standard medical management and follow-up for primary outcome event of vertebrobasilar territory stroke. Quantitative magnetic resonance angiography imaging was repeated at 6, 12, and 24 months. Flow status over time was examined relative to baseline and relative to subsequent stroke risk using a cause-specific proportional hazard model, with flow status treated as a time-varying covariate. Mean blood pressure was examined to assess for association with changes in flow status. RESULTS: Over 19{$\pm$}8 months of follow-up, 132 follow-up quantitative magnetic resonance angiography studies were performed in 58 of the 72 enrolled patients. Of the 13 patients with serial imaging who had low flow at baseline, 7 (54\%) had improvement to normal flow at the last follow-up. Of the 45 patients who had normal flow at baseline, 3 (7\%) converted to low flow at the last follow-up. The mean blood pressure did not differ in patients with or without changes in flow status. The time-varying flow status remained a strong predictor of subsequent stroke (hazard ratio, 10.3 [95\% CI, 2.2\textendash 48.7]). CONCLUSIONS: There is potential both for improvement and worsening of hemodynamics in patients with atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar disease. Flow status, both at baseline and over time, is a risk factor for subsequent stroke, thus serving as an important prognostic marker.},

  abstract = {Septic shock remains a health care concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock recommend early fluid resuscitation and antimicrobials. Beyond initial management, the guidelines do not provide clear recommendations on appropriate time to initiate vasoactive therapies and corticosteroids in patients who develop shock. This review summarizes the literature regarding time of initiation of these interventions. Clinical data regarding time of initiation of these therapies in relation to shock onset, sequence of treatments with regard to each other, and clinical markers evaluated to guide initiation are summarized. Early-high vasopressor initiation within first 6~h of shock onset is associated with lower mortality. Following norepinephrine initiation, the exact dose and timing of escalation to adjunctive vasopressor agents are not well elucidated in the literature. However, recent data indicate that timing may be an important factor in initiating vasopressors and adjunctive therapies, such as corticosteroids. Norepinephrine-equivalent dose and lactate concentration can aid in determining when to initiate vasopressin and angiotensin II in patients with septic shock. Future guidelines with clear recommendations on the time of initiation of septic shock therapies are warranted.},

  abstract = {It has long been argued that we need to consider much more than an observed point estimate and a p-value to understand statistical results. One of the most persistent misconceptions about p-values is that they are necessarily calculated assuming a null hypothesis of no effect is true. Instead, p-values can and should be calculated for multiple hypothesized values for the effect size. For example, a p-value function allows us to visualize results continuously by examining how the p-value varies as we move across possible effect sizes. For more focused discussions, a 95\% confidence interval shows the subset of possible effect sizes that have p-values larger than 0.05 as calculated from the same data and the same background statistical assumptions. In this sense a confidence interval can be taken as showing the effect sizes that are most compatible with the data, given the assumptions, and thus may be better termed a compatibility interval. The question that should then be asked is whether any or all of the effect sizes within the interval are substantial enough to be of practical importance.},

  abstract = {The widespread use of `statistical significance' as a license for making a claim of a scientific finding leads to considerable distortion of the scientific process (according to the American Statistical Association). We review why degrading               p               -values into `significant' and `nonsignificant' contributes to making studies irreproducible, or to making them seem irreproducible. A major problem is that we tend to take small               p               -values at face value, but mistrust results with larger               p               -values. In either case,               p               -values tell little about reliability of research, because they are hardly replicable even if an alternative hypothesis is true. Also significance (               p               ~{$\leq~$}0.05) is hardly replicable: at a good statistical power of 80\%, two studies will be `conflicting', meaning that one is significant and the other is not, in one third of the cases if there is a true effect. A replication can therefore not be interpreted as having failed only because it is nonsignificant. Many apparent replication failures may thus reflect faulty judgment based on significance thresholds rather than a crisis of unreplicable research. Reliable conclusions on replicability and practical importance of a finding can only be drawn using cumulative evidence from multiple independent studies. However, applying significance thresholds makes cumulative knowledge unreliable. One reason is that with anything but ideal statistical power, significant effect sizes will be biased upwards. Interpreting inflated significant results while ignoring nonsignificant results will thus lead to wrong conclusions. But current incentives to hunt for significance lead to selective reporting and to publication bias against nonsignificant findings. Data dredging,               p               -hacking, and publication bias should be addressed by removing fixed significance thresholds. Consistent with the recommendations of the late Ronald Fisher,               p               -values should be interpreted as graded measures of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Also larger               p               -values offer some evidence against the null hypothesis, and they cannot be interpreted as supporting the null hypothesis, falsely concluding that `there is no effect'. Information on possible true effect sizes that are compatible with the data must be obtained from the point estimate, e.g., from a sample average, and from the interval estimate, such as a confidence interval. We review how confusion about interpretation of larger               p               -values can be traced back to historical disputes among the founders of modern statistics. We further discuss potential arguments against removing significance thresholds, for example that decision rules should rather be more stringent, that sample sizes could decrease, or that               p               -values should better be completely abandoned. We conclude that whatever method of statistical inference we use, dichotomous threshold thinking must give way to non-automated informed judgment.},

  abstract = {Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a ``replication crisis'' may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systolic blood pressure of more than 185 mm Hg is a contraindication to thrombolytic treatment with intravenous alteplase in patients with acute ischaemic stroke, but the target systolic blood pressure for optimal outcome is uncertain. We assessed intensive blood pressure lowering compared with guideline-recommended blood pressure lowering in patients treated with alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke. METHODS: We did an international, partial-factorial, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial of thrombolysis-eligible patients (age {$\geq$}18 years) with acute ischaemic stroke and systolic blood pressure 150 mm Hg or more, who were screened at 110 sites in 15 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1, by means of a central, web-based program) within 6 h of stroke onset to receive intensive (target systolic blood pressure 130-140 mm Hg within 1 h) or guideline (target systolic blood pressure {$<$}180 mm Hg) blood pressure lowering treatment over 72 h. The primary outcome was functional status at 90 days measured by shift in modified Rankin scale scores, analysed with unadjusted ordinal logistic regression. The key safety outcome was any intracranial haemorrhage. Primary and safety outcome assessments were done in a blinded manner. Analyses were done on intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01422616. FINDINGS: Between March 3, 2012, and April 30, 2018, 2227 patients were randomly allocated to treatment groups. After exclusion of 31 patients because of missing consent or mistaken or duplicate randomisation, 2196 alteplase-eligible patients with acute ischaemic stroke were included: 1081 in the intensive group and 1115 in the guideline group, with 1466 (67{$\cdot$}4\%) administered a standard dose among the 2175 actually given intravenous alteplase. Median time from stroke onset to randomisation was 3{$\cdot$}3 h (IQR 2{$\cdot$}6-4{$\cdot$}1). Mean systolic blood pressure over 24 h was 144{$\cdot$}3 mm Hg (SD 10{$\cdot$}2) in the intensive group and 149{$\cdot$}8 mm Hg (12{$\cdot$}0) in the guideline group (p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Primary outcome data were available for 1072 patients in the intensive group and 1108 in the guideline group. Functional status (mRS score distribution) at 90 days did not differ between groups (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 1{$\cdot$}01, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}87-1{$\cdot$}17, p=0{$\cdot$}8702). Fewer patients in the intensive group (160 [14{$\cdot$}8\%] of 1081) than in the guideline group (209 [18{$\cdot$}7\%] of 1115) had any intracranial haemorrhage (OR 0{$\cdot$}75, 0{$\cdot$}60-0{$\cdot$}94, p=0{$\cdot$}0137). The number of patients with any serious adverse event did not differ significantly between the intensive group (210 [19{$\cdot$}4\%] of 1081) and the guideline group (245 [22{$\cdot$}0\%] of 1115; OR 0{$\cdot$}86, 0{$\cdot$}70-1{$\cdot$}05, p=0{$\cdot$}1412). There was no evidence of an interaction of intensive blood pressure lowering with dose (low vs standard) of alteplase with regard to the primary outcome. INTERPRETATION: Although intensive blood pressure lowering is safe, the observed reduction in intracranial haemorrhage did not lead to improved clinical outcome compared with guideline treatment. These results might not support a major shift towards this treatment being applied in those receiving alteplase for mild-to-moderate acute ischaemic stroke. Further research is required to define the underlying mechanisms of benefit and harm resulting from early intensive blood pressure lowering in this patient group.

To maximize interpretation, we present a post hoc Bayesian reanalysis.           Design:~           Bayesian reanalysis of a randomized placebo-controlled trial.           Setting:~           Thirty-five ICUs.           Patients:~           Adults with proven or suspected infection, vasopressor support, and no more than 24 hours of ICU admission.           Interventions:~           Patients were allocated to receive either vitamin C (50\,mg/kg of body weight) or placebo every 6 hours for up to 96 hours.           Measurements and Main Results:~           The primary outcome was the composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction (i.e., vasopressor use, invasive mechanical ventilation, or new renal replacement therapy) at 28 days. We used Bayesian log-binomial models with random effects for hospital site and varying informative prior beliefs for the effect of vitamin C to estimate risk ratios (RRs) with 95\% credible intervals (Crls) in the intention to treat population (vitamin C, 435 patients; placebo, 437 patients). Using weakly neutral priors, patients allocated to vitamin C had a higher risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days (RR, 1.20; 95\% Crl, 1.04\textendash 1.39; probability of harm, 99\%). This effect was consistent when using optimistic (RR, 1.14; 95\% Crl, 1.00\textendash 1.31; probability of harm, 98\%) and empiric (RR, 1.09; 95\% Crl, 0.97\textendash 1.22; probability of harm, 92\%) priors. Patients allocated to vitamin C also had a higher risk of death at 28 days under weakly neutral (RR, 1.17; 95\% Crl, 0.98\textendash 1.40; probability of harm, 96\%), optimistic (RR, 1.10; 95\% Crl, 0.94\textendash 1.30; probability of harm, 88\%), and empiric (RR, 1.05; 95\% Crl, 0.92\textendash 1.19; probability of harm, 76\%) priors.           Conclusions:~           The use of vitamin C in adult patients with proven or suspected infection and vasopressor support is associated with high probability of harm.},

However, DAGs can be difficult to design, and the validity of any DAG-derived strategy hinges on the validity of the postulated DAG itself. Researchers should therefore check whether the assumptions encoded in the DAG are consistent with the data before proceeding with the analysis. Here, we explain how the R package `dagitty', based on the web tool dagitty.net, can be used to test the statistical implications of the assumptions encoded in a given DAG. We hope that this will help researchers discover model specification errors, avoid erroneous conclusions, and build better models. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors.

  abstract = {Significance testing based on p-values has been implicated in the reproducibility crisis in scientific research, with one of the proposals being to eliminate them in favor of Bayesian analyses. Defenders of the p-values have countered that it is the improper use and errors in interpretation, rather than the p-values themselves that are to blame. Similar exchanges about the role of p-values have occurred with some regularity every 10 to 15 years since their formal introduction in statistical practice. The apparent contradiction between the repeated failures in interpretation and continuous use of p-values suggest that there is an inferential value in the computation of these values. In this work we propose to attach a radical Bayesian interpretation to the number computed and reported as a p-value for the Generalized Linear Model, which has been the workhorse of applied statistical work. We introduce a decision analytic framework for thresholding posterior tail areas (pi-values) which for any given Bayesian analysis will have a direct correspondence to p-values in non-Bayesian approaches. Pi-values are non-controversial, posterior probability summaries of treatment effects. A predictive probability argument is made to justify the exploration of the stochastic variation (replication probability) of p and pi-values and culminates into a concrete proposal for the synthesis of Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to data analyses that aim for reproducibility. We illustrate these concepts using the results of recent randomized controlled trials in cardiometabolic and kidney diseases and provide R code for the implementation of the proposed methodology.},

We report data from the phase 2 component of MOVe-IN, a clinical trial evaluating molnupiravir in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. METHODS We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 2/3 trial in patients 18 years old and older requiring in-hospital treatment for laboratoryconfirmed Covid-19 with symptom onset 10 or fewer days before randomization. Participants were randomly assigned to placebo or molnupiravir 200 mg, 400 mg, or 800 mg (1:1:1:1 ratio), twice daily for 5 days. Primary end points were safety and sustained recovery (participant alive and either not hospitalized or medically ready for discharge) through day 29. RESULTS Of 304 randomly assigned participants, 218 received at least one dose of molnupiravir and 75 of placebo. At baseline, 74.0\% had at least one risk factor for severe Covid-19. Adverse events were reported in 121 of 218 (55.5\%) molnupiravir-treated and 46 of 75 (61.3\%) placebo-treated participants, with no apparent dose effect on adverse event rates and no evidence of hematologic toxicity based on prespecified adverse events. Of 16 confirmed deaths, most were in participants with severe Covid-19 (75.0\%), with underlying comorbidities (87.5\%), older than 60 years of age (81.3\%), and/or symptom duration longer than 5 days (75.0\%) at randomization. Median time to sustained recovery was 9 days in all groups, with similar day 29 recovery rates ranging from 81.5\% to 85.2\%. CONCLUSIONS In this phase 2 trial of patients hospitalized with Covid-19, a 5-day course of molnupiravir up to 800 mg twice daily was not associated with dose-limiting},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is a common condition in the ICU. Despite much research, its prognosis remains poor. In 2017, a retrospective before/after study reported promising results using a combination of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone called ``metabolic resuscitation cocktail'' and several randomized controlled trials assessing its effectiveness were performed. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in septic ICU patients to assess the effects of this combination therapy. SETTING: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library databases were searched from inception to March of 2021. Data were extracted independently by two authors. The main outcome was the change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score within 72 hours. Secondary outcomes included renal composite endpoints (acute kidney injury) Kidney Disease - Improving Global Outcome organization stage 3 or need for renal replacement therapy, vasopressor duration, and 28-day mortality. SUBJECTS: We included randomized controlled trials with patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis or septic shock. INTERVENTION: The trials compared a combination of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone to standard care or placebo in patients admitted to ICU with sepsis or septic shock. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included eight randomized controlled trials (n = 1,335 patients). Within 72 hours, the median of mean improvement was \textendash 1.8 and \textendash 3.2 in the control and intervention groups, respectively (eight randomized controlled trials, n = 1,253 patients); weighted mean difference \textendash 0.82 (95\% CI, \textendash 1.15 to \textendash 0.48). Data were homogeneous and the funnel plot did not suggest any publication bias. Duration of vasopressor requirement was significantly reduced in the intervention group (six randomized controlled trials). There was no evidence of a difference regarding the ICU mortality and the renal composite outcome (acute kidney injury KDIGO 3 or need for renal replacement therapy, seven randomized controlled trials). CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic resuscitation cocktail administrated in ICU septic patients improves change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score within 72 hours. However, this improvement is modest and its clinical relevance is questionable. The impact on renal failure and mortality remains unclear.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Although the three vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) that have received emergency use authorization in the United States are highly effective, breakthrough infections are occurring. Data are needed on the serial use of homologous boosters (same as the primary vaccine) and heterologous boosters (different from the primary vaccine) in fully vaccinated recipients. METHODS In this phase 1\textendash 2, open-label clinical trial conducted at 10 sites in the United States, adults who had completed a Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier and had no reported history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines: mRNA-1273 (Moderna) at a dose of 100 {$\mu$}g, Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson \& Johnson\textendash Janssen) at a dose of 5\texttimes 1010 virus particles, or BNT162b2 (Pfizer\textendash BioNTech) at a dose of 30 {$\mu$}g. The primary end points were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on trial days 15 and 29. RESULTS Of the 458 participants who were enrolled in the trial, 154 received mRNA-1273, 150 received Ad26.COV2.S, and 153 received BNT162b2 as booster vaccines; 1 participant did not receive the assigned vaccine. Reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series. More than half the recipients reported having injection-site pain, malaise, headache, or myalgia. For all combinations, antibody neutralizing titers against a SARS-CoV-2 D614G pseudovirus increased by a factor of 4 to 73, and binding titers increased by a factor of 5 to 55. Homologous boosters increased neutralizing antibody titers by a factor of 4 to 20, whereas heterologous boosters increased titers by a factor of 6 to 73. Spike-specific T-cell responses increased in all but the homologous Ad26.COV2.S-boosted subgroup. CD8+ T-cell levels were more durable in the Ad26.COV2.S-primed recipients, and heterologous boosting with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine substantially increased spike-specific CD8+ T cells in the mRNA vaccine recipients.

We carried out eight iterative reflective cycles with a group of clinical teachers. The repeated phases of experimentation and observation were conducted by participants in their own clinical teaching setting. Our findings were tested and validated on both an individual and collective basis Results: We found five categories of clinical reasoning difficulties as they present in the clinical teaching settings. We identified indicators for each. Indicators may be different depending on the type of supervision. These findings were assembled and organized to construct a guide for clinical teachers. Conclusions: The guide should assist clinical teachers in detecting clinical reasoning difficulties during clinical teaching and in providing remediation that is tailored to the specific difficulty identified. Its development furthers our understanding of clinical reasoning difficulties and provides a useful tool.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis, it is uncertain whether decompression surgery alone is noninferior to decompression with instrumented fusion. METHODS We conducted an open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial involving patients with symptomatic lumbar stenosis that had not responded to conservative management and who had single-level spondylolisthesis of 3 mm or more. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo decompression surgery (decompressionalone group) or decompression surgery with instrumented fusion (fusion group). The primary outcome was a reduction of at least 30\% in the score on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI; range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more impairment) during the 2 years after surgery, with a noninferiority margin of -15 percentage points. Secondary outcomes included the mean change in the ODI score as well as scores on the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire, leg and back pain, the duration of surgery and length of hospital stay, and reoperation within 2 years. RESULTS The mean age of patients was approximately 66 years. Approximately 75\% of the patients had leg pain for more than a year, and more than 80\% had back pain for more than a year. The mean change from baseline to 2 years in the ODI score was -20.6 in the decompression-alone group and -21.3 in the fusion group (mean difference, 0.7; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -2.8 to 4.3). In the modified intentionto-treat analysis, 95 of 133 patients (71.4\%) in the decompression-alone group and 94 of 129 patients (72.9\%) in the fusion group had a reduction of at least 30\% in the ODI score (difference, -1.4 percentage points; 95\% CI, -12.2 to 9.4), showing the noninferiority of decompression alone. In the per-protocol analysis, 80 of 106 patients (75.5\%) and 83 of 110 patients (75.5\%), respectively, had a reduction of at least 30\% in the ODI score (difference, 0.0 percentage points; 95\% CI, -11.4 to 11.4), showing noninferiority. The results for the secondary outcomes were generally in the same direction as those for the primary outcome. Successful fusion was achieved with certainty in 86 of 100 patients (86.0\%) who had imaging available at 2 years. Reoperation was performed in 15 of 120 patients (12.5\%) in the decompression-alone group and in 11 of 121 patients (9.1\%) in the fusion group. CONCLUSIONS In this trial involving patients who underwent surgery for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, most of whom had symptoms for more than a year, decompression alone was noninferior to decompression with instrumented fusion over a period of 2 years. Reoperation occurred somewhat more often in the decompressionalone group than in the fusion group. (NORDSTEN-DS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02051374.)},

Results The use of 0.9\% saline is believed to have originated during the cholera pandemic that swept across Europe in 1831. However, an examination of the composition of the fluids used by the pioneering physicians of that era reveals solutions that bear no resemblance to 0.9\% or so-called `normal' saline which appears to have very little scientific or historical basis for its routine use, except for Hamburger's in vitro studies of red cell lysis. Conclusions The currently used 0.9\% saline solution is without convincing historical basis. Given that the composition of 0.9\% sodium chloride is dissimilar to most solutions used in the past, and is in no way `normal' or `physiological', our current practice may be based on historical fallacy and misconception.},

  abstract = {Summary: In this review, we discuss the utility of quantitative EEG parameters for the detection of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in the context of the complex pathophysiology of DCI and the limitations of current diagnostic methods. Because of the multifactorial pathophysiology of DCI, methodologies solely assessing blood vessel narrowing (vasospasm) are insufficient to detect all DCI. Quantitative EEG has facilitated the exploration of EEG as a diagnostic modality of DCI. Multiple quantitative EEG parameters such as alpha power, relative alpha variability, and alpha/delta ratio show reliable detection of DCI in multiple studies. Recent studies on epileptiform abnormalities suggest that their potential for the detection of DCI. Quantitative EEG is a promising, continuous, noninvasive, monitoring modality of DCI implementable in daily practice. Future work should validate these parameters in larger populations, facilitated by the development of automated detection algorithms and multimodal data integration.},

Recent findings The appropriate utilization of ICU beds is essential, but it is complex and a challenge to attain. To date there are no widely accepted international guidelines for managing these acute brain-injured patients (stroke, TBI, postneurosurgery) in the ICU. The criteria for ICU admission after neurological acute injury, high-dependency unit or a specialized neurosurgical ward vary from institution to institution depending on local structures and characteristics of the available resources. Better evidence to standardize the treatment and the degree of monitoring is needed during neurological acute injury. It is highly recommended to implement clinical vigilance in these patients regardless of their destination (ICU, stroke unit or ward). Summary Currently evidence do not allow to define standardized protocol to guide ICU admission for acute neurological patients (TBI patients, postoperative neurosurgical procedures and stroke).}

  abstract = {Many patients worldwide receive platelet components (PCs) through the transfusion of diverse types of blood components. PC transfusions are essential for the treatment of central thrombocytopenia of diverse causes, and such treatment is beneficial in patients at risk of severe bleeding. PC transfusions account for almost 10\% of all the blood components supplied by blood services, but they are associated with about 3.25 times as many severe reactions (attributable to transfusion) than red blood cell transfusions after stringent in-process leukoreduction to less than 106 residual cells per blood component. PCs are not homogeneous, due to the considerable differences between donors. Furthermore, the modes of PC collection and preparation, the safety precautions taken to limit either the most common (allergic-type reactions and febrile non-hemolytic reactions) or the most severe (bacterial contamination, pulmonary lesions) adverse reactions, and storage and conservation methods can all result in so-called PC ``storage lesions''. Some storage lesions affect PC quality, with implications for patient outcome. Good transfusion practices should result in higher levels of platelet recovery and efficacy, and lower complication rates. These practices include a matching of tissue ABH antigens whenever possible, and of platelet HLA (and, to a lesser extent, HPA) antigens in immunization situations. This review provides an overview of all the available information relating to platelet transfusion, from donor and donation to bedside transfusion, and considers the impact of the measures applied to increase transfusion efficacy while improving safety and preventing transfusion inefficacy and refractoriness. It also considers alternatives to platelet component (PC) transfusion. Acute platelet transfusion after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) given in efforts to reverse antiplatelet medication effects and prevent ongoing bleeding does not appear to improve outcome and may be associated with harm. Although the underlying mechanisms are unclear, the influence of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions on ICH outcomes has not been investigated. We hypothesized that patients with ICH who receive ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions would have worse platelet recovery (using absolute count increment [ACI]) and neurological outcomes (mortality and poor modified Rankin Scale [mRS 4-6]) than those receiving ABO-compatible transfusions. In a single-center cohort of consecutively admitted patients with ICH, we identified 125 patients receiving acute platelet transfusions, of whom 47 (38\%) received an ABO-incompatible transfusion. Using quantile regression, we identified an association of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion with lower platelet recovery (ACI, 2 \texttimes{} 103cells per {$\mu$}L vs 15 \texttimes{} 103cells per {$\mu$}L; adjusted coefficient {$\beta$}, -19; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -35.55 to -4.44; P = .01). ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion was also associated with increased odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.59; 95\% CI, 1.00-6.73; P = .05) and poor mRS (adjusted OR, 3.61; 95\% CI, 0.97-13.42; P = .06); however, these estimates were imprecise. Together, these findings suggest the importance of ABO compatibility for platelet transfusions for ICH, but further investigation into the mechanism(s) underlying these observations is required.},

  abstract = {Background               Intracerebral hemorrhage remains the deadliest form of stroke worldwide, inducing neuronal death through a wide variety of pathways. Therapeutic hypothermia is a robust and well-studied neuroprotectant widely used across a variety of specialties.                                         Aims               This review summarizes results from preclinical and clinical studies to highlight the overall effectiveness of therapeutic hypothermia to improve long-term intracerebral hemorrhage outcomes while also elucidating optimal protocol regimens to maximize therapeutic effect.                                         Summary of review               A systematic review was conducted across three databases to identify trials investigating the use of therapeutic hypothermia to treat intracerebral hemorrhage. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on preclinical studies, looking at neurobehavioral outcomes, blood brain barrier breakdown, cerebral edema, hematoma volume, and tissue loss. Several mixed-methods meta-regression models were also performed to adjust for variance and variations in hypothermia induction procedures. Twwenty-one preclinical studies and five human studies were identified. The meta-analysis of preclinical studies demonstrated a significant benefit in behavioral scores (ES\,=\,-0.43, p\,=\,0.02), cerebral edema (ES\,=\,1.32, p\,=\,0.0001), and blood brain barrier (ES\,=\,2.73, p\,{$\leq$}\,0.00001). Therapeutic hypothermia was not found to significantly affect hematoma expansion (ES\,=\,-0.24, p\,=\,0.12) or tissue loss (ES\,=\,0.06, p\,=\,0.68). Clinical study outcome reporting was heterogeneous; however, there was recurring evidence of therapeutic hypothermia-induced edema reduction.                                         Conclusions               The combined preclinical evidence demonstrates that therapeutic hypothermia reduced multiple cell death mechanisms initiated by intracerebral hemorrhage; yet, there is no definitive evidence in clinical studies. The cooling strategies employed in both preclinical and clinical studies were highly diverse, and focused refinement of cooling protocols should be developed in future preclinical studies. The current data for therapeutic hypothermia in intracerebral hemorrhage remains questionable despite the highly promising indications in preclinical studies. Definitive randomized controlled studies are still required to answer this therapeutic question.},

  abstract = {Clinical and pathophysiological understanding of septic shock has progressed exponentially in the previous decades, translating into a steady decrease in septic shock-related morbidity and mortality. Even though large randomized, controlled trials have addressed fundamental aspects of septic shock resuscitation, many questions still exist. In this review, we will describe the current standards of septic shock resuscitation, but the emphasis will be placed on evolv-ing concepts in different domains such as clinical resuscitation targets, adequate use of fluids and vasoactive drugs, refractory shock, and the use of extracorporeal therapies. Multiple research opportunities remain open, and collabora-tive endeavors should be performed to fill in these gaps.},

In accordance with the protocol, patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) were assigned to receive balanced multielectrolyte solution (BMES) or saline during their entire stay in the ICU. The median duration of treatment with the assigned trial fluid was 6.0 days (interquartile range, 3.0 to 10.0) in both groups.

  abstract = {This essay traces the history of refereeing at specialist scientific journals and at funding bodies and shows that it was only in the late twentieth century that peer review came to be seen as a process central to scientific practice. Throughout the nineteenth century and into much of the twentieth, external referee reports were considered an optional part of journal editing or grant making. The idea that refereeing is a requirement for scientific legitimacy seems to have arisen first in the Cold War United States. In the 1970s, in the wake of a series of attacks on scientific funding, American scientists faced a dilemma: there was increasing pressure for science to be accountable to those who funded it, but scientists wanted to ensure their continuing influence over funding decisions. Scientists and their supporters cast expert refereeing\textemdash or ``peer review,'' as it was increasingly called\textemdash as the crucial process that ensured the credibility of science as a whole. Taking funding decisions out of expert hands, they argued, would be a corruption of science itself. This public elevation of peer review both reinforced and spread the belief that only peer-reviewed science was scientifically legitimate.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Investigations of rapid neurological improvement (RNI) in patients with acute cerebral ischemia (ACI) have focused upon RNI occurring after hospital arrival. However, with stroke routing decisions and interventions increasingly migrating to the prehospital setting, there is a need to delineate the frequency, magnitude, predictors, and clinical outcomes of ACI patients with ultra-early RNI (U-RNI) in the prehospital and early post-arrival period. METHODS: We analyzed prospectively collected data of the prehospital Field Administration of Stroke Therapy-Magnesium (FAST-MAG) randomized clinical trial. Any U-RNI was defined as improvement by 2 or more points on the Los Angeles Motor Scale (LAMS) score between the prehospital and early post-Emergency Department (ED) arrival exams and classified as moderate (2-3 point) or dramatic (4-5 point) improvement. Outcomes measures included excellent recovery [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-1] and death by 90 days. RESULTS: Among the 1,245 ACI patients, mean age was 70.9 years (standard deviation 13.2); 45\% were women; median prehospital-LAMS was 4 [interquartile range (IQR) 3-5]; median last known well to ED-LAMS time was 59 minutes (IQR 46-80) and median prehospital-LAMS to ED-LAMS time was 33 minutes (IQR 28-39). Overall, any U-RNI occurred in 31\%, moderate U-RNI in 23\%, and dramatic U-RNI in 8\%. Any U-RNI was associated with improved outcomes, including excellent recovery (mRS 0-1) at 90 days 65.1\% (246/378) vs 35.4\% (302/852), p{$<$}0.0001; decreased mortality by 90 days 3.7\% (14/378) vs 16.4\% (140/852), p{$<$}0.0001; decreased symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage 1.6\% (6/384) vs 4.6\% (40/861), p=0.0112 ; increased likelihood of being discharged home 56.8\% (218/384) vs. 30.2\% (260/861), p {$<$}0.0001. DISCUSSION: U-RNI occurs in nearly 1 in 3 ambulance-transported patients with ACI and is associated with excellent recovery and decreased mortality at 90 days. Accounting for U-RNI may be useful for routing decisions and future prehospital interventions.},

  abstract = {Smoking is often identified as a confounder of the obesity\textendash mortality relationship. Selection bias can amplify the magnitude of an existing confounding bias. The objective of the present report is to demonstrate how confounding bias due to cigarette smoking is increased in the presence of collider stratification bias using an empirical example and directed acyclic graphs. The empirical example uses data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a prospective cohort study of 15,792 men and women in the United States. Poisson regression models were used to examine the confounding effect of smoking. In the total ARIC study population, smoking produced a confounding bias of \textbackslash 3 percentage points. This result was obtained by comparing the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for obesity from a model adjusted for smoking was 1.07 (95 \% CI 1.00, 1.15) with one that did not adjust for smoking was 1.10 (95 \% CI 1.03, 1.18). However, among smokers with CVD, the obesity IRR was 0.89 (95 \% CI 0.81, 0.99), while among non-smokers with CVD the obesity IRR was 1.20 (95 \% CI 1.03, 1.41). The empirical and graphical explanations presented suggest that the magnitude of the confounding bias induced by smoking is greater in the presence of collider stratification bias.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Preapproval trials showed that messenger RNA (mRNA)\textendash based vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had a good safety profile, yet these trials were subject to size and patient-mix limitations. An evaluation of the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine with respect to a broad range of potential adverse events is needed. METHODS We used data from the largest health care organization in Israel to evaluate the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. For each potential adverse event, in a population of persons with no previous diagnosis of that event, we individually matched vaccinated persons to unvaccinated persons according to sociodemographic and clinical variables. Risk ratios and risk differences at 42 days after vaccination were derived with the use of the Kaplan\textendash Meier estimator. To place these results in context, we performed a similar analysis involving SARS-CoV-2\textendash infected persons matched to uninfected persons. The same adverse events were studied in the vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection analyses. The authors' affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

RESULTS In the vaccination analysis, the vaccinated and control groups each included a mean of 884,828 persons. Vaccination was most strongly associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 3.24; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 12.44; risk difference, 2.7 events per 100,000 persons; 95\% CI, 1.0 to 4.6), lymphadenopathy (risk ratio, 2.43; 95\% CI, 2.05 to 2.78; risk difference, 78.4 events per 100,000 persons; 95\% CI, 64.1 to 89.3), appendicitis (risk ratio, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.02 to 2.01; risk difference, 5.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95\% CI, 0.3 to 9.9), and herpes zoster infection (risk ratio, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.20 to 1.73; risk difference, 15.8 events per 100,000 persons; 95\% CI, 8.2 to 24.2). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a substantially increased risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 18.28; 95\% CI, 3.95 to 25.12; risk difference, 11.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95\% CI, 5.6 to 15.8) and of additional serious adverse events, including pericarditis, arrhythmia, deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS In this study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting, the BNT162b2 vaccine was not associated with an elevated risk of most of the adverse events examined. The vaccine was associated with an excess risk of myocarditis (1 to 5 events per 100,000 persons). The risk of this potentially serious adverse event and of many other serious adverse events was substantially increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Sabizabulin is an oral, novel microtubule disruptor that has dual antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities in preclinical models. METHODS A randomized, multicenter placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial was conducted with hospitalized patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 who were at high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to 9 mg of oral sabizabulin or placebo daily (up to 21 days). The primary end point was all-cause mortality up to day 60. Key secondary end points were days in the intensive care unit (ICU), days on mechanical ventilation, and days in the hospital. RESULTS A total of 204 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 134 to sabizabulin and 70 to placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar. Sabizabulin superiority was demonstrated by a planned interim analysis for the first 150 randomized patients. Sabizabulin treatment resulted in a 24.9 percentage point absolute reduction and a 55.2\% relative reduction in deaths compared with placebo (odds ratio, 3.23; 95\% CI confidence interval, 1.45 to 7.22; P=0.0042). The mortality rate was 20.2\% (19 of 94) for sabizabulin versus 45.1\% (23 of 51) for placebo. For the key secondary end points, sabizabulin treatment resulted in a 43\% relative reduction in ICU days (P=0.0013), a 49\% relative reduction in days on mechanical ventilation (P=0.0013), and a 26\% relative reduction in days in the hospital (P=0.0277) versus placebo. Adverse and serious adverse events were lower in the sabizabulin group compared with the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS Sabizabulin treatment resulted in a 24.9\% absolute reduction in deaths compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 at high risk for ARDS and death, with a lower incidence of adverse and serious adverse events compared with placebo.

On one of the teams, all of their patients received adjunctive hydroxychloroquine as part of their admission medications. A second team, doing their daily rounds on the same floor of the hospital, chose the opposite approach\textemdash none of their patients received it. Members of both teams could mobilize logical arguments in favor of their practice, while simultaneously acknowledging that they were doing so without high-quality data from randomized clinical trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ARDS Clinical Trials Network recommends a target partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) between 55 and 80 mm Hg. Prospective validation of this range in patients with ARDS is lacking. We hypothesized that targeting the lower limit of this range would improve outcomes in patients with ARDS. METHODS In this multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned patients with ARDS to receive either conservative oxygen therapy (target Pao2, 55 to 70 mm Hg; oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry [Spo2], 88 to 92\%) or liberal oxygen therapy (target Pao2, 90 to 105 mm Hg; Spo2, {$\geq$}96\%) for 7 days.

RESULTS After the enrollment of 205 patients, the trial was prematurely stopped by the data and safety monitoring board because of safety concerns and a low likelihood of a significant difference between the two groups in the primary outcome. Four patients who did not meet the eligibility criteria were excluded. At day 28, a total of 34 of 99 patients (34.3\%) in the conservative-oxygen group and 27 of 102 patients (26.5\%) in the liberal-oxygen group had died (difference, 7.8 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -4.8 to 20.6). At day 90, 44.4\% of the patients in the conservative-oxygen group and 30.4\% of the patients in the liberal-oxygen group had died (difference, 14.0 percentage points; 95\% CI, 0.7 to 27.2). Five mesenteric ischemic events occurred in the conservative-oxygen group. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with ARDS, early exposure to a conservative-oxygenation strategy with a Pao2 between 55 and 70 mm Hg did not increase survival at 28 days.

  abstract = {Background In view of substantial mis-estimation of risks of diabetes complications using existing equations, we sought to develop updated Risk Equations for Complications Of type 2 Diabetes (RECODe). Methods To develop and validate these risk equations, we used data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes study (ACCORD, n=9635; 2001\textendash 09) and validated the equations for microvascular events using data from the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS, n=1018; 1996\textendash 2001), and for cardiovascular events using data from the Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD, n=4760; 2001\textendash 12). Microvascular outcomes were nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Cardiovascular outcomes were myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality. We also included all-cause mortality as an outcome. We used a cross-validating machine learning method to select predictor variables from demographic characteristics, clinical variables, comorbidities, medications, and biomarkers into Cox proportional hazards models for each outcome. The new equations were compared to older risk equations by assessing model discrimination, calibration, and the net reclassification index. Findings All equations had moderate internal and external discrimination (C-statistics 0{$\cdot$}55\textendash 0{$\cdot$}84 internally, 0{$\cdot$}57\textendash 0{$\cdot$}79 externally) and high internal and external calibration (slopes 0{$\cdot$}71\textendash 1{$\cdot$}31 between observed and estimated risk). Our equations had better discrimination and calibration than the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model 2 (for microvascular and cardiovascular outcomes, C-statistics 0{$\cdot$}54\textendash 0{$\cdot$}62, slopes 0{$\cdot$}06\textendash 1{$\cdot$}12) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Pooled Cohort Equations (for fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, C-statistics 0{$\cdot$}61\textendash 0{$\cdot$}66, slopes 0{$\cdot$}30\textendash 0{$\cdot$}39). Interpretation RECODe might improve estimation of risk of complications for patients with type 2 diabetes.

Clinical research is generally supported by grants or contracts, and it is very unusual for the NIH to withhold or withdraw funds for a study if appropriate documented progress is being made and no ethical or other scientific issues have arisen. However, in the past few decades, patient advocacy groups and new foundations, often with the active engagement of the individual(s) who created the foundation, have begun to fund biomedical research. It is important for investigators, and the offices of sponsored programs at the investigators' institutions, who are usually responsible for the contractual relationship between an investigator (or institution) and the funder, to be aware of the details governing and ensuring the ongoing support of a study.},

  abstract = {Background: Withdrawal of support in patients with severe brain injury invariably leads to death. Preconceived notions about futility of care in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) may prompt withdrawal of support, and modeling outcome in patient populations in whom withdrawal of support occurs may lead to self-fulfilling prophecies. Methods: Subjects included consecutive patients with supratentorial ICH. Radiographic characteristics of the hemorrhage, clinical variables, and neurologic outcome were assessed. Attitudes about futility of care were examined among members of the departments of neurology and neurologic surgery through a written survey and case presentations. Results: There were 87 patients with supratentorial ICH; overall mortality was 34.5\% (30/87). Mortality was 66.7\% (18/27) in patients with Glasgow Coma Score {$\leq$}8 and ICH volume {$>$}60 cm3. Medical support was withdrawn in 76.7\% (23/30) of patients who died. Inclusion of a variable to account for the withdrawal of support in a model predicting outcome negated the predictive value of all other variables. Patients undergoing surgical decompression were unlikely to have support withdrawn, and surgery was less likely to be performed in older patients (p {$<$} 0.01) and patients with left hemispheric hemorrhage (p = 0.04). Survey results suggested that practitioners tend to be overly pessimistic in prognosticating outcome based upon data available at the time of presentation. Conclusions: The most important prognostic variable in determining outcome after ICH is the level of medical support provided. Withdrawal of support in patients felt likely to have a ``poor outcome'' biases predictive models and leads to self-fulfilling prophecies. Our data show that individual patients in traditionally ``poor outcome'' categories can have a reasonable neurologic outcome when treated aggressively.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), no antiviral agents have yet been shown to be efficacious. METHODS We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only. RESULTS A total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo). Those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (95\% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 11), as compared with 15 days (95\% CI, 13 to 18) among those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95\% CI, 1.12 to 1.49; P{$<$}0.001, by a log-rank test). In an analysis that used a proportional-odds model with an eight-category ordinal scale, the patients who received remdesivir were found to be more likely than those who received placebo to have clinical improvement at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 1.9, after adjustment for actual disease severity). The Kaplan\textendash Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7\% with remdesivir and 11.9\% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4\% with remdesivir and 15.2\% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received remdesivir (24.6\%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6\%).

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Limited information exists about the epidemiology, recognition, management, and outcomes of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate intensive care unit (ICU) incidence and outcome of ARDS and to assess clinician recognition, ventilation management, and use of adjuncts-for example prone positioning-in routine clinical practice for patients fulfilling the ARDS Berlin Definition. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (LUNG SAFE) was an international, multicenter, prospective cohort study of patients undergoing invasive or noninvasive ventilation, conducted during 4 consecutive weeks in the winter of 2014 in a convenience sample of 459 ICUs from 50 countries across 5 continents. EXPOSURES: Acute respiratory distress syndrome. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was ICU incidence of ARDS. Secondary outcomes included assessment of clinician recognition of ARDS, the application of ventilatory management, the use of adjunctive interventions in routine clinical practice, and clinical outcomes from ARDS. RESULTS: Of 29,144 patients admitted to participating ICUs, 3022 (10.4\%) fulfilled ARDS criteria. Of these, 2377 patients developed ARDS in the first 48 hours and whose respiratory failure was managed with invasive mechanical ventilation. The period prevalence of mild ARDS was 30.0\% (95\% CI, 28.2\%-31.9\%); of moderate ARDS, 46.6\% (95\% CI, 44.5\%-48.6\%); and of severe ARDS, 23.4\% (95\% CI, 21.7\%-25.2\%). ARDS represented 0.42 cases per ICU bed over 4 weeks and represented 10.4\% (95\% CI, 10.0\%-10.7\%) of ICU admissions and 23.4\% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Clinical recognition of ARDS ranged from 51.3\% (95\% CI, 47.5\%-55.0\%) in mild to 78.5\% (95\% CI, 74.8\%-81.8\%) in severe ARDS. Less than two-thirds of patients with ARDS received a tidal volume 8 of mL/kg or less of predicted body weight. Plateau pressure was measured in 40.1\% (95\% CI, 38.2-42.1), whereas 82.6\% (95\% CI, 81.0\%-84.1\%) received a positive end-expository pressure (PEEP) of less than 12 cm H2O. Prone positioning was used in 16.3\% (95\% CI, 13.7\%-19.2\%) of patients with severe ARDS. Clinician recognition of ARDS was associated with higher PEEP, greater use of neuromuscular blockade, and prone positioning. Hospital mortality was 34.9\% (95\% CI, 31.4\%-38.5\%) for those with mild, 40.3\% (95\% CI, 37.4\%-43.3\%) for those with moderate, and 46.1\% (95\% CI, 41.9\%-50.4\%) for those with severe ARDS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among ICUs in 50 countries, the period prevalence of ARDS was 10.4\% of ICU admissions. This syndrome appeared to be underrecognized and undertreated and associated with a high mortality rate. These findings indicate the potential for improvement in the management of patients with ARDS.

  abstract = {The debate on the use and misuse of P values has risen and fallen throughout their almost century-long existence in scientific discovery. Over the past few years, the debate has again received front-page attention, particularly through the public reminder by the American Statistical Association on how P values should be used and interpreted. At the core of the issue lies a fault in the way that scientific evidence is dichotomized and research is subsequently reported, and this fault is exacerbated by researchers giving license to statistical models to do scientific inference. This paper highlights a different approach to handling the evidence collected during a randomized controlled trial, one that does not dichotomize, but rather reports the evidence collected. Through the use of a coin flipping experiment and reanalysis of real-world data, the traditional approach of testing null hypothesis significance is contrasted with a Bayesian approach. This paper is meant to be understood by those who rely on statistical models to draw conclusions from data, but are not statisticians and may therefore not be able to grasp the debate that is primarily led by statisticians.},

Such a seemingly innocent question evokes concerns of type I and II errors among those who believe that certainty can be the product of uncertainty and among researchers who have been told that they need to carefully calculate sample sizes, consider multiplicity, and not spend P values on interim analyses. However, the endeavor to dichotomize evidence into significant and nonsignificant has led to the basic driving force of science, namely uncertainty, to take a back seat. In this viewpoint we discuss that if testing the null hypothesis is the ultimate goal of science, then we need not worry about writing protocols, consider ethics, apply for funding, or run any experiments at all\textemdash all null hypotheses will be rejected at some point\textemdash everything has an effect. The job of science should be to unearth the uncertainties of the effects of treatments, not to test their difference from zero. We also show the fickleness of P values, how they may one day point to statistically significant results; and after a few more participants have been recruited, the once statistically significant effect suddenly disappears. We show plots which we hope would intuitively highlight that all assessments of evidence will fluctuate over time. Finally, we discuss the remedy in the form of Bayesian methods, where uncertainty leads; and which allows for continuous decision making to stop or continue recruitment, as new data from a trial is accumulated.},

  abstract = {Researchers commonly use p-values to answer the question: How strongly does the evidence favor the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis? p-Values themselves do not directly answer this question and are often misinterpreted in ways that lead to overstating the evidence against the null hypothesis. Even in the ``post p {$<$} 0.05 era,'' however, it is quite possible that p-values will continue to be widely reported and used to assess the strength of evidence (if for no other reason than the widespread availability and use of statistical software that routinely produces p-values and thereby implicitly advocates for their use). If so, the potential for misinterpretation will persist. In this article, we recommend three practices that would help researchers more accurately interpret p-values. Each of the three recommended practices involves interpreting p-values in light of their corresponding ``Bayes factor bound,'' which is the largest odds in favor of the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis that is consistent with the observed data. The Bayes factor bound generally indicates that a given p-value provides weaker evidence against the null hypothesis than typically assumed. We therefore believe that our recommendations can guard against some of the most harmful p-value misinterpretations. In research communities that are deeply attached to reliance on ``p {$<$} 0.05,'' our recommendations will serve as initial steps away from this attachment. We emphasize that our recommendations are intended merely as initial, temporary steps and that many further steps will need to be taken to reach the ultimate destination: a holistic interpretation of statistical evidence that fully conforms to the principles laid out in the ASA statement on statistical significance and p-values.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the benefits and risks of adding a P2Y12 inhibitor to anticoagulant therapy among non\textendash critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An open-label, bayesian, adaptive randomized clinical trial including 562 non\textendash critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was conducted between February 2021 and June 2021 at 60 hospitals in Brazil, Italy, Spain, and the US. The date of final 90-day follow-up was September 15, 2021. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to a therapeutic dose of heparin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor (n = 293) or a therapeutic dose of heparin only (usual care) (n = 269) in a 1:1 ratio for 14 days or until hospital discharge, whichever was sooner. Ticagrelor was the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The composite primary outcome was organ support\textendash free days evaluated on an ordinal scale that combined in-hospital death (assigned a value of -1) and, for those who survived to hospital discharge, the number of days free of respiratory or cardiovascular organ support up to day 21 of the index hospitalization (range, -1 to 21 days; higher scores indicate less organ support and better outcomes). The primary safety outcome was major bleeding by 28 days as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis. RESULTS Enrollment of non\textendash critically ill patients was discontinued when the prespecified criterion for futility was met. All 562 patients who were randomized (mean age, 52.7 [SD, 13.5] years; 41.5\% women) completed the trial and 87\% received a therapeutic dose of heparin by the end of study day 1. In the P2Y12 inhibitor group, ticagrelor was used in 63\% of patients and clopidogrel in 37\%. The median number of organ support\textendash free days was 21 days (IQR, 20-21 days) among patients in the P2Y12 inhibitor group and was 21 days (IQR, 21-21 days) in the usual care group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95\% credible interval, 0.55-1.25]; posterior probability of futility [defined as an odds ratio {$<$}1.2], 96\%). Major bleeding occurred in 6 patients (2.0\%) in the P2Y12 inhibitor group and in 2 patients (0.7\%) in the usual care group (adjusted odds ratio, 3.31 [95\% CI, 0.64-17.2]; P = .15). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among non\textendash critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19, the use of a P2Y12 inhibitor in addition to a therapeutic dose of heparin, compared with a therapeutic dose of heparin only, did not result in an increased odds of improvement in organ support\textendash free days within 21 days during hospitalization.},

  abstract = {\textbf{\emph{Background and Purpose:}} Hemispheric location might influence outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). INTERACT suggested higher short-term mortality in right hemispheric ICH, yet statistical imbalances were not addressed. This study aimed at determining the differences in long-term functional outcome in patients with right- vs. left-sided ICH with a priori-defined sub-analysis of lobar vs. deep bleedings. \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} Data from a prospective hospital registry were analyzed including patients with ICH admitted between January 2006 and August 2014. Data were retrieved from institutional databases. Outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Outcome measures (long-term mortality and functional outcome at 12 months) were correlated with ICH location and hemisphere, and the imbalances of baseline characteristics were addressed by propensity score matching. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} A total of 831 patients with supratentorial ICH (429 left and 402 right) were analyzed. Regarding clinical baseline characteristics in the unadjusted overall cohort, there were differences in disfavor of right-sided ICH (antiplatelets: 25.2\% in left ICH vs. 34.3\% in right ICH; \emph{p} {$<$} 0.01; previous ischemic stroke: 14.7\% in left ICH vs. 19.7\% in right ICH; \emph{p} = 0.057; and presence/extent of intraventricular hemorrhage: 45.0\% in left ICH vs. 53.0\% in right ICH; \emph{p} = 0.021; Graeb-score: 0 [0-4] in left ICH vs. 1 [0-5] in right ICH; \emph{p} = 0.017). While there were no differences in mortality and in the proportion of patients with favorable vs. unfavorable outcome (mRS 0-3: 142/375 [37.9\%] in left ICH vs. 117/362 [32.3\%] in right ICH; \emph{p} = 0.115), patients with left-sided ICH showed excellent outcome more frequently (mRS 0-1: 64/375 [17.1\%] in left ICH vs. 43/362 [11.9\%] in right ICH; \emph{p} = 0.046) in the unadjusted analysis. After adjusting for confounding variables, a well-balanced group of patients (\emph{n} = 360/hemisphere) was compared showing no differences in long-term functional outcome (mRS 0-3: 36.4\% in left ICH vs. 33.9\% in right ICH; \emph{p} = 0.51). Sub-analyses of patients with deep vs. lobar ICH revealed also no differences in outcome measures (mRS 0-3: 53/151 [35.1\%] in left deep ICH vs. 53/165 [32.1\%] in right deep ICH; \emph{p} = 0.58). \textbf{\emph{Conclusion:}} Previously described differences in clinical end points among patients with left- vs. right-hemispheric ICH may be driven by different baseline characteristics rather than by functional deficits emerging from different hemispheric functions affected. After statistical corrections for confounding variables, there was no impact of hemispheric location on functional outcome after ICH.},

  abstract = {Purpose\hspace{0.6em} Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis continues to be the most common form of sporadic lethal encephalitis worldwide. The wide spectrum of clinical presentations and laboratory findings often poses a diagnostic challenge for physicians which might delay administration of life-saving therapy with acyclovir. Atypical presentations of HSV encephalitis have become increasingly prevalent with better diagnostic techniques and have not been well studied. Methods\hspace{0.6em} We retrospectively evaluated all consecutive PCR-proven HSV encephalitis cases treated at the Hospital of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich, Germany from January 1, 2013 to February 28, 2018. Results\hspace{0.6em} We included 18 patients with PCR-proven HSV encephalitis. The most common clinical features were altered mental status (77.8\%), focal neurologic deficits (72.2\%) and fever (72.2\%). Remarkably, four of these patients (22.2\%) had a normocellular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on admission. Electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities were highly sensitive for HSV encephalitis independent of CSF cell count. Striking atypical findings on MRI were extensive global brain swelling and severe brainstem involvement in single patients. Of note, initial CT scans were normal in 11 out of 16 patients (68.8\%). All patients were treated with acyclovir. Three patients still developed a clinical deterioration under therapy with acyclovir with one patient requiring decompressive craniotomy due to bilateral space-occupying temporal lobe hemorrhage. 94.4\% of the patients survived but only 38.9\% were discharged with a good clinical outcome (Glasgow Outcome Score\,=\,5). Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Atypical presentations of HSV encephalitis seem to be more common than previously thought and physicians should apply a high level of clinical suspicion and a low threshold to initiate life-saving acyclovir therapy in suspected cases.},

  abstract = {When a patient is admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after a traumatic brain injury (TBI), an early prognosis is essential for baseline risk adjustment and shared decision making. TBI outcomes are commonly categorised by the Glasgow Outcome Scale\textendash Extended (GOSE) into eight, ordered levels of functional recovery at 6 months after injury. Existing ICU prognostic models predict binary outcomes at a certain threshold of GOSE (e.g., prediction of survival [GOSE {$>$} 1]). We aimed to develop ordinal prediction models that concurrently predict probabilities of each GOSE score. From a prospective cohort (n = 1,550, 65 centres) in the ICU stratum of the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) patient dataset, we extracted all clinical information within 24 hours of ICU admission (1,151 predictors) and 6-month GOSE scores. We analysed the effect of two design elements on ordinal model performance: (1) the baseline predictor set, ranging from a concise set of ten validated predictors to a token-embedded representation of all possible predictors, and (2) the modelling strategy, from ordinal logistic regression to multinomial deep learning. With repeated k-fold cross-validation, we found that expanding the baseline predictor set significantly improved ordinal prediction performance while increasing analytical complexity did not. Half of these gains could be achieved with the addition of eight high-impact predictors to the concise set. At best, ordinal models achieved 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.74\textendash 0.77) ordinal discrimination ability (ordinal c-index) and 57\% (95\% CI: 54\%\textendash{} 60\%) explanation of ordinal variation in 6-month GOSE (Somers' Dxy). Model performance and the effect of expanding the predictor set decreased at higher GOSE thresholds, indicating the difficulty of predicting better functional outcomes shortly after ICU admission. Our results motivate the search for informative predictors that improve confidence in prognosis of higher GOSE and the development of ordinal dynamic prediction models.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome and identification of sub-phenotypes is essential. This study used trajectories of vital signs to develop and validate sub-phenotypes and investigated the interaction of sub-phenotypes with treatment using randomized controlled trial data. METHODS: All patients with suspected infection admitted to four academic hospitals in Emory Healthcare between 2014-2017 (training cohort) and 2018-2019 (validation cohort) were included. Group-based trajectory modeling was applied to vital signs from the first 8~h of hospitalization to develop and validate vitals trajectory sub-phenotypes. The associations between sub-phenotypes and outcomes were evaluated in patients with sepsis. The interaction between sub-phenotype and treatment with balanced crystalloids versus saline was tested in a secondary analysis of SMART (Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial). RESULTS: There were 12,473 patients with suspected infection in training and 8256 patients in validation cohorts, and 4 vitals trajectory sub-phenotypes were found. Group A (N\,=\,3483, 28\%) were hyperthermic, tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypotensive. Group B (N\,=\,1578, 13\%) were hyperthermic, tachycardic, tachypneic (not as pronounced as Group A) and hypertensive. Groups C (N\,=\,4044, 32\%) and D (N\,=\,3368, 27\%) had lower temperatures, heart rates, and respiratory rates, with Group C normotensive and Group D hypotensive. In the 6,919 patients with sepsis, Groups A and B were younger while Groups C and D were older. Group A had the lowest prevalence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease, while Group B had the highest prevalence. Groups A and D had the highest vasopressor use (p\,{$<$}\,0.001 for all analyses above). In logistic regression, 30-day mortality was significantly higher in Groups A and D (p\,{$<$}\,0.001 and p\,=\,0.03, respectively). In the SMART trial, sub-phenotype significantly modified treatment effect (p\,=\,0.03). Group D had significantly lower odds of mortality with balanced crystalloids compared to saline (odds ratio (OR) 0.39, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.67, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). CONCLUSION: Sepsis sub-phenotypes based on vital sign trajectory were consistent across cohorts, had distinct outcomes, and different responses to treatment with balanced crystalloids versus saline.},

  abstract = {Background In patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), coma is associated with impaired subcortical arousal mechanisms. However, it is unknown which nuclei involved in arousal (arousal nuclei) are implicated in coma pathogenesis and are compatible with coma recovery. Methods We mapped an atlas of arousal nuclei in the brainstem, thalamus, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain onto 3 tesla susceptibility-weighted images (SWI) in 12 patients with acute severe TBI who presented in coma and recovered consciousness within 6 months. We assessed the spatial distribution and volume of SWI microbleeds and evaluated the association of microbleed volume with the duration of unresponsiveness and functional recovery at 6 months. Results There was no single arousal nucleus affected by microbleeds in all patients. Rather, multiple combinations of microbleeds in brainstem, thalamic, and hypothalamic arousal nuclei were associated with coma and were compatible with recovery of consciousness. Microbleeds were frequently detected in the midbrain (100\%), thalamus (83\%), and pons (75\%). Within the brainstem, the microbleed incidence was largest within the mesopontine tegmentum (e.g., pedunculotegmental nucleus, mesencephalic reticular formation) and ventral midbrain (e.g., substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area). Brainstem arousal nuclei were partially affected by microbleeds, with microbleed volume not exceeding 35\% of brainstem nucleus volume on average. Compared to microbleed volume within nonarousal brainstem regions, the microbleed volume within arousal brainstem nuclei accounted for a larger proportion of variance in the duration of unresponsiveness and 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale\textendash Extended scores. Conclusion These results suggest resilience of arousal mechanisms in the human brain after severe TBI.},

  abstract = {Demand for intensive care unit (ICU) resources often exceeds supply, and shortages of ICU beds and staff are likely to persist. Triage requires careful weighing of the benefits and risks involved in ICU admission while striving to guarantee fair distribution of available resources. We must ensure that the patients who occupy ICU beds are those most likely to benefit from the ICU's specialized technology and professionals. Although prognosticating is not an exact science, preference should be given to patients who are more likely to survive if admitted to the ICU but unlikely to survive or likely to have more significant morbidity if not admitted. To provide general guidance for intensivists in ICU triage decisions, a task force of the World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine addressed 4 basic questions regarding this process. The team made recommendations and concluded that triage should be led by intensivists considering input from nurses, emergency medicine professionals, hospitalists, surgeons, and allied professionals. Triage algorithms and protocols can be useful but can never supplant the role of skilled intensivists basing their decisions on input from multidisciplinary teams. Infrastructures need to be organized efficiently both within individual hospitals and at the regional level. When resources are critically limited, patients may be refused ICU admission if others may benefit more on the basis of the principle of distributive justice.}

The concept of ventilator-free days has been proposed as an outcome combining these two outcomes. Here we analyzed the construction of the ventilator-free day outcome and provided a hypothetical scenario to alert physicians that such an outcome can lead to misleading interpretations.         Methods:~         We proposed the isoventilator-free day curve concept and, using an analytical development, illustrated how a median ventilator-free day value can actually result from very different combinations of death rates and mechanical ventilation durations. We also used a hypothetical example to compare the Student t test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and Gray test (which accounts for death as a competing event with extubation) in comparing exposition to mechanical ventilation.         Results:~         A median ventilator-free day value of 10 days may mean that 10\% of the patients died while survivors were ventilated during a median of 14 days or that 40\% died while survivors were ventilated during a median of 5 days. Changing the time horizon affected the Student t test but not the Wilcoxon rank-sum result. The Gray test was more relevant than both the Student t test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test in identifying differences in groups showing highly different mechanical ventilation duration, despite equal median ventilator-free days. This approach was also illustrated using real data.         Conclusions:~         Use of ventilator-free days as an outcome appears to have many drawbacks. Suitable methods of analyzing time to extubation should be preferred.},

  abstract = {Background: A causal relationship between statin use and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is uncertain. We hypothesized that an association between long-term statin exposure and ICH risk might vary for different ICH locations. Methods: We conducted this analysis using linked Danish nationwide registries. Within the Southern Denmark Region (population 1.2 million), we identified all first-ever cases of ICH between 2009-2018 in persons ages {$>$}55 years. Patients with medical record verified diagnoses were classified as having a lobar or non-lobar ICH and matched for age, sex, and calendar year to general population controls. We used a nationwide prescription registry to ascertain prior statin and other medication use that we classified for recency, duration, and intensity. Using conditional logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders, we calculated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and corresponding 95\% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for the risk of lobar and non-lobar ICH. Results: We identified 989 patients with lobar ICH (52.2\% women, mean age 76.3-years) who we matched to 39,500 controls, and 1,175 patients with non-lobar ICH (46.5\% women, mean age 75.1-years) who we matched to 46,755 controls. Current statin use was associated with a lower risk of lobar (aOR 0.83; 95\%CI, 0.70-0.98) and non-lobar ICH (aOR 0.84; 95\%CI, 0.72-0.98). Longer duration of statin use was also associated with lower risk of lobar ({$<$}1 year: aOR 0.89; 95\%CI, 0.69-1.14; {$\geq$}1 year to {$<$}5years aOR 0.89; 95\%CI 0.73-1.09; {$\geq$}5 years aOR 0.67; 95\%CI, 0.51-0.87; p for trend 0.040) and non-lobar ICH ({$<$}1 year: aOR1.00; 95\%CI, 0.80-1.25; {$\geq$}1 year to {$<$}5years aOR 0.88; 95\%CI 0.73-1.06; {$\geq$}5 years aOR 0.62; 95\%CI, 0.48-0.80; p for trend {$<$}0.001). Estimates stratified by statin intensity were similar to the main estimates for low-medium intensity therapy (lobar aOR 0.82; non-lobar aOR 0.84); the association with high intensity therapy was neutral. Discussion: We found that statin use was associated with a lower risk of ICH, particularly with longer treatment duration. This association did not vary by hematoma location.},

  abstract = {Purpose:\hspace{0.6em} Hyperglycaemia is an adaptive response to stress commonly observed in critical illness. Its management remains debated in the intensive care unit (ICU). Individualising hyperglycaemia management, by targeting the patient's pre-admission usual glycaemia, could improve outcome. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} In a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, critically-ill adults were considered for inclusion. Patients underwent until ICU discharge either individualised glucose control by targeting the pre-admission usual glycaemia using the glycated haemoglobin A1c level at ICU admission (IC group), or conventional glucose control by maintaining glycaemia below 180 mg/dL (CC group). A non-commercial web application of a dynamic sliding-scale insulin protocol gave to nurses all instructions for glucose control in both groups. The primary outcome was death within 90 days. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Owing to a low likelihood of benefit and evidence of the possibility of harm related to hypoglycaemia, the study was stopped early. 2075 patients were randomized; 1917 received the intervention, 942 in the IC group and 975 in the CC group. Although both groups showed significant differences in terms of glycaemic control, survival proba-bility at 90-day was not significantly different (IC group: 67.2\%, 95\% CI [64.2\%; 70.3\%]; CC group: 69.6\%, 95\% CI [66.7\%; 72.5\%]). Severe hypoglycaemia (below 40 mg/dL) occurred in 3.9\% of patients in the IC group and in 2.5\% of patients in the CC group (p\,=\,0.09). A post hoc analysis showed for non-diabetic patients a higher risk of 90-day mortality in the IC group compared to the CC group (HR 1.3, 95\% CI [1.05; 1.59], p\,=\,0.018).},

  abstract = {Methods: Data were collected from the cognitive substudy of the Targeted Temperature Management-trial. Caregiver burden was assessed with the 22-item Zarit Burden Interview, with scores 20 considered as no burden. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the SF-36v2\`O, with Tscores 47\textendash 53 representing the norm. Cardiac arrest survivors were categorized based on the results from cognitive assessments as having ``no cognitive impairment'' or ``cognitive impairment''. Results: Follow-up 6 months post event was performed for caregivers of 272 cardiac arrest survivors and 108 matched myocardial infarction controls, included at an intended ratio of 2:1. In general, caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and controls reported similar caregiver burden. The overall scores for quality of life were within normative levels and similar for caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and control patients. Compared to those with no cognitive impairment, caregivers of cognitively impaired cardiac arrest survivors (n = 126) reported higher levels of burden (median 18 versus 8, p {$<$} 0.001) and worse quality of life in five of eight domains, particularly ``Role-Emotional'' (mean 45.7 versus 49.5, p = 0.002). Conclusions: In general, caregivers of cardiac arrest survivors and myocardial infarction controls reported similar levels of burden and quality of life. Cognitive outcome and functional dependency of the cardiac arrest survivor impact burden and quality of life of the caregiver.},

  abstract = {Background               Shared decision making requires evidence to be conveyed to the patient in a way they can easily understand and compare. Patient decision aids facilitate this process. This article reviews the current evidence for how to present numerical probabilities within patient decision aids.                                         Methods               Following the 2013 review method, we assembled a group of 9 international experts on risk communication across Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We expanded the topics covered in the first review to reflect emerging areas of research. Groups of 2 to 3 authors reviewed the relevant literature based on their expertise and wrote each section before review by the full authorship team.                                         Results               Of 10 topics identified, we present 5 fundamental issues in this article. Although some topics resulted in clear guidance (presenting the chance an event will occur, addressing numerical skills), other topics (context/evaluative labels, conveying uncertainty, risk over time) continue to have evolving knowledge bases. We recommend presenting numbers over a set time period with a clear denominator, using consistent formats between outcomes and interventions to enable unbiased comparisons, and interpreting the numbers for the reader to meet the needs of varying numeracy.                                         Discussion               Understanding how different numerical formats can bias risk perception will help decision aid developers communicate risks in a balanced, comprehensible manner and avoid accidental ``nudging'' toward a particular option. Decisions between probability formats need to consider the available evidence and user skills. The review may be useful for other areas of science communication in which unbiased presentation of probabilities is important.},

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in the ICU. Preexisting AF is highly prevalent among older patients with chronic conditions who are at risk for critical illness, whereas new-onset AF can be triggered by accelerated atrial remodeling and arrhythmogenic triggers encountered during critical illness. The acute loss of atrial systole and onset of rapid ventricular rates that characterize new-onset AF often lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic compromise. Thus, new-onset AF is both a marker of disease severity as well as a likely contributor to poor outcomes, similar to other manifestations of organ dysfunction during critical illness. Evaluating immediate hemodynamic effects of new-onset AF during critical illness is an important component of rapid clinical assessment aimed at identifying patients in need of urgent direct current cardioversion, treatment of reversible inciting factors, and identification of patients who may benefit from pharmacologic rate or rhythm control. In addition to acute hemodynamic effects, new-onset AF during critical illness is associated with both short- and long-term increases in the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death, with AF recurrence rates of approximately 50\%~within 1 year following hospital discharge. In the absence of a strong evidence base, there is substantial practice variation in the choice of strategies for management of new-onset AF during critical illness. We describe acute and long-term evaluation and management strategies based on current evidence and propose future avenues of investigation to fill large knowledge gaps in the management of patients with AF during critical illness.},

Research Question What are the practice patterns and comparative effectiveness for inhaled nitric oxide and epoprostenol in severe acute respiratory failure? Study Design and Methods Using a large United States database (Premier Healthcare Database), we identified adult patients with acute respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome who were mechanically ventilated and started on inhaled nitric oxide, epoprostenol or both. Leveraging large hospital variation in the choice of initial inhaled vasodilator, we compared the effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide to epoprostenol by limiting analysis to patients admitted to hospitals that exclusively used either inhaled nitric oxide or epoprostenol. The primary outcome of successful extubation was modeled using multivariable Fine-Grey competing risk (death or hospice discharge) time to event models. Results Among 11,200 patients (303 hospitals), 6,366 (56.8\%) received inhaled nitric oxide first, 4,720 (42.1\%) received inhaled epoprostenol first, and 114 (1.0\%) received both therapies on the same day. 104 hospitals (34.3\%; 1,666 patients) exclusively used nitric oxide and 118 hospitals (38.9\%; 1,812 patients) exclusively used epoprostenol. There were no differences in the likelihood of successful extubation between patients admitted to nitric oxide-only hospitals versus epoprostenol-only hospitals (sub-distribution hazard ratio 0.97, 95\% CI 0.80-1.18). There were also no differences in total hospital costs or death. Results were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. Interpretation There is large variation in the use of initial inhaled vasodilator for respiratory failure across United hospitals. Comparative effectiveness analyses identified no differences in outcomes based on inhaled vasodilator type.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To test whether early vs standard tracheostomy improved functional outcome among patients with stroke receiving mechanical ventilation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this randomized clinical trial, 382 patients with severe acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke receiving invasive ventilation were randomly assigned (1:1) to early tracheostomy (Յ5 days of intubation) or ongoing ventilator weaning with standard tracheostomy if needed from day 10. Patients were randomized between July 28, 2015, and January 24, 2020, at 26 US and German neurocritical care centers. The final date of follow-up was August 9, 2020. INTERVENTIONS Patients were assigned to an early tracheostomy strategy (n = 188) or to a standard tracheostomy (control group) strategy (n = 194). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was functional outcome at 6 months, based on the modified Rankin Scale score (range, 0 [best] to 6 [worst]) dichotomized to a score of 0 (no disability) to 4 (moderately severe disability) vs 5 (severe disability) or 6 (death). RESULTS Among 382 patients randomized (median age, 59 years; 49.8\% women), 366 (95.8\%) completed the trial with available follow-up data on the primary outcome (177 patients [94.1\%] in the early group; 189 patients [97.4\%] in the standard group). A tracheostomy (predominantly percutaneously) was performed in 95.2\% of the early tracheostomy group in a median of 4 days after intubation (IQR, 3-4 days) and in 67\% of the control group in a median of 11 days after intubation (IQR, 10-12 days). The proportion without severe disability (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-4) at 6 months was not significantly different in the early tracheostomy vs the control group (43.5\% vs 47.1\%; difference, -3.6\% [95\% CI, -14.3\% to 7.2\%]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.93 [95\% CI, 0.60-1.42]; P = .73). Of the serious adverse events, 5.0\% (6 of 121 reported events) in the early tracheostomy group vs 3.4\% (4 of 118 reported events) were related to tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with severe stroke receiving mechanical ventilation, a strategy of early tracheostomy, compared with a standard approach to tracheostomy, did not significantly improve the rate of survival without severe disability at 6 months. However, the wide confidence intervals around the effect estimate may include a clinically important difference, so a clinically relevant benefit or harm from a strategy of early tracheostomy cannot be excluded.},

Eligible patients were consecutive ICU-admitted adults with COVID-19 AHRF. Randomization used a 2\,\texttimes\,3 factorial design for dexamethasone and oxygenation strategies; patients not eligible for at least 1 oxygenation strategy and/or already receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) were only randomized for dexamethasone. All patients were followed-up for 60 days. Data were analyzed from May 26 to July 31, 2021.Patients received standard dexamethasone (dexamethasone-phosphate 6 mg/d for 10 days [or placebo prior to RECOVERY trial results communication]) or high-dose dexamethasone (dexamethasone-phosphate 20 mg/d on days 1-5 then 10 mg/d on days 6-10). Those not requiring IMV were additionally randomized to o2SC, CPAP, or HFNo2.The main outcomes were time to all-cause mortality, assessed at day 60, for the dexamethasone interventions, and time to IMV requirement, assessed at day 28, for the oxygenation interventions. Differences between intervention groups were calculated using proportional Cox models and expressed as hazard ratios (HRs).Among 841 screened patients, 546 patients (median [IQR] age, 67.4 [59.3-73.1] years; 414 [75.8\%] men) were randomized between standard dexamethasone (276 patients, including 37 patients who received placebo) or high-dose dexamethasone (270 patients). Of these, 333 patients were randomized among o2SC (109 patients, including 56 receiving standard dexamethasone), CPAP (109 patients, including 57 receiving standard dexamethasone), and HFNo2 (115 patients, including 56 receiving standard dexamethasone). There was no difference in 60-day mortality between standard and high-dose dexamethasone groups (HR, 0.96 [95\% CI, 0.69-1.33]; P\,=\,.79). There was no significant difference for the cumulative incidence of IMV criteria at day 28 among o2 support groups (o2SC vs CPAP: HR, 1.08 [95\% CI, 0.71-1.63]; o2SC vs HFNo2: HR, 1.04 [95\% CI, 0.69-1.55]) or 60-day mortality (o2SC vs CPAP: HR, 0.97 [95\% CI, 0.58-1.61; o2SC vs HFNo2: HR, 0.89 [95\% CI, 0.53-1.47]). Interactions between interventions were not significant.In this randomized clinical trial among ICU patients with COVID-19\textendash related AHRF, high-dose dexamethasone did not significantly improve 60-day survival. The oxygenation strategies in patients who were not initially receiving IMV did not significantly modify 28-day risk of IMV requirement.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04344730; EudraCT: 2020-001457-43.},

  abstract = {Purpose:\hspace{0.6em} Whether epinephrine or norepinephrine is preferable as the continuous intravenous vasopressor used to treat post-resuscitation shock is unclear. We assessed outcomes of patients with post-resuscitation shock after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest according to whether the continuous intravenous vasopressor used was epinephrine or norepinephrine. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We conducted an observational multicenter study of consecutive patients managed in 2011\textendash 2018 for post-resuscitation shock. The primary outcome was all-cause hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were cardiovascular hospital mortality and unfavorable neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category 3\textendash 5). A mul-tivariate regression analysis and a propensity score analysis were performed, as well as several sensitivity analyses. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Of the 766 patients included in five hospitals, 285 (37\%) received epinephrine and 481 (63\%) norepineph-rine. All-cause hospital mortality was significantly higher in the epinephrine group (OR 2.6; 95\%CI 1.4\textendash 4.7; P\,=\,0.002). Cardiovascular hospital mortality was also higher with epinephrine (aOR 5.5; 95\%CI 3.0\textendash 10.3; P\,{$<$}\,0.001), as was the proportion of patients with CPC of 3\textendash 5 at hospital discharge. Sensitivity analyses produced consistent results. The analysis involving adjustment on a propensity score to control for confounders showed similar findings (aOR 2.1; 95\%CI 1.1\textendash 4.0; P\,=\,0.02). Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Among patients with post-resuscitation shock after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, use of epinephrine was associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular-specific mortality, compared with norepinephrine infusion. Until additional data become available, intensivists may want to choose norepinephrine rather than epinephrine for the treatment of post-resuscitation shock after OHCA.},

Follow-up was completed on August 31, 2021.Intravenous administration of 1 mL/kg of 4F-PCC (25 IU of factor IX/kg) vs 1 mL/kg of saline solution (placebo). Patients, investigators, and data analysts were blinded to treatment assignment. All patients received early ratio-based transfusion (packed red blood cells:fresh frozen plasma ratio of 1:1 to 2:1) and were treated according to European traumatic hemorrhage guidelines.The primary outcome was 24-hour all blood product consumption (efficacy); arterial or venous thromboembolic events were a secondary outcome (safety).Of 4313 patients with the highest trauma level activation, 350 were eligible for emergency inclusion, 327 were randomized, and 324 were analyzed (164 in the 4F-PCC group and 160 in the placebo group). The median (IQR) age of participants was 39 (27-56) years, Injury Severity Score was 36 (26-50 [major trauma]), and admission blood lactate level was 4.6 (2.8-7.4) mmol/L; prehospital arterial systolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg in 179 of 324 patients (59\%), 233 patients (73\%) were men, and 226 (69\%) required expedient hemorrhage control. There was no statistically or clinically significant between-group difference in median (IQR) total 24-hour blood product consumption (12 [5-19] U in the 4F-PCC group vs 11 [6-19] U in the placebo group; absolute difference, 0.2 U [95\% CI, -2.99 to 3.33]; P\,=\,.72).

Unknown HIV-positive disease status, antiretroviral drug resistance, poor drug compliance, and recreational drug abuse are factors that continue to influence the morbidity and mortality of infections. The clinical and radiographic pattern of CNS opportunistic infections is unique in the setting of HIV infection: opportunistic infections in HIV-positive patients often have characteristic clinical and radiological presentations that can differ from the presentation of opportunistic infections in immunocompetent patients and are often sufficient to establish the diagnosis. ART in the setting of these opportunistic infections can lead to a paradoxical worsening caused by an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). In this Review, we discuss several of the most common CNS opportunistic infections: cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leuko\- encephalopathy (PML), tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis and cytomegalovirus infection, with an emphasis on clinical pearls, pathological findings, MRI findings and treatment. Moreover, we discuss the risk factors, pathophysiology and management of IRIS. We also summarize the challenges that remain in management of CNS opportunistic infections, which includes the lack of phase II and III clinical trials, absence of antimicrobials for infections such as PML, and controversy regarding the use of corticosteroids for treatment of IRIS.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Infected necrotizing pancreatitis is a potentially lethal disease that is treated with the use of a step-up approach, with catheter drainage often delayed until the infected necrosis is encapsulated. Whether outcomes could be improved by earlier catheter drainage is unknown. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, randomized superiority trial involving patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis, in which we compared immediate drainage within 24 hours after randomization once infected necrosis was diagnosed with drainage that was postponed until the stage of walled-off necrosis was reached. The primary end point was the score on the Comprehensive Complication Index, which incorporates all complications over the course of 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS A total of 104 patients were randomly assigned to immediate drainage (55 patients) or postponed drainage (49 patients). The mean score on the Comprehensive Complication Index (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe complications) was 57 in the immediate-drainage group and 58 in the postponed-drainage group (mean difference, -1; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -12 to 10; P\,=\,0.90). Mortality was 13\% in the immediate-drainage group and 10\% in the postponed-drainage group (relative risk, 1.25; 95\% CI, 0.42 to 3.68). The mean number of interventions (catheter drainage and necrosectomy) was 4.4 in the immediate-drainage group and 2.6 in the postponed-drainage group (mean difference, 1.8; 95\% CI, 0.6 to 3.0). In the postponed-drainage group, 19 patients (39\%) were treated conservatively with antibiotics and did not require drainage; 17 of these patients survived. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS This trial did not show the superiority of immediate drainage over postponed drainage with regard to complications in patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis. Patients randomly assigned to the postponed-drainage strategy received fewer invasive interventions. (Funded by Fonds NutsOhra and Amsterdam UMC; POINTER ISRCTN Registry number, ISRCTN33682933.)},

Methods An observational cohort study was conducted using population-level data from Alberta, Canada. Individuals diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer between April 2015 and December 2019 were identified through the provincial cancer registry and followed until March 2021. Records were linked to other administrative databases containing information on relevant variables. Individuals were excluded if they did not have adequate hemoglobin, platelet, white blood cell, and serum creatinine measures or if they received prior therapy. The observational analog of the per-protocol effect was estimated using inverse probability weighted Kaplan-Meier curves with bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals. Results Four hundred seven individuals were eligible. The weighted median overall survival was 8.3 months (95\% CI, 5.7\textendash 11.9) for FOLFIRINOX and 5.1 months (95\% CI: 4.3 to 5.8) for GN. The adjusted difference in median overall survival was 3.2 months (95\% CI, 1.1\textendash 7.4) and the mortality hazard ratio was 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.61\textendash 0.97).

In this paper, we provide the first quasi-experimental estimates of the impact of social media on mental health by leveraging a unique natural experiment: the staggered introduction of Facebook across U.S. colleges. Our analysis couples data on student mental health around the years of Facebook's expansion with a generalized difference-in-differences empirical strategy. We find that the roll-out of Facebook at a college increased symptoms of poor mental health, especially depression, and led to increased utilization of mental healthcare services. We also find that, according to the students' reports, the decline in mental health translated into worse academic performance. Additional evidence on mechanisms suggests the results are due to Facebook fostering unfavorable social comparisons.},

  abstract = {Background The Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) Score is a validated scale describing the essentials of a coma examination, including motor response, eye opening and eye movements, brainstem reflexes, and respiratory pattern. We incorporated the FOUR Score into the existing ICH Score and evaluated its accuracy of risk assessment in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Materials and Methods Consecutive patients admitted to our institution from 2009 to 2012 with spontaneous ICH were reviewed. The ICH Score was calculated using patient age, hemorrhage location, hemorrhage volume, evidence of intraventricular extension, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The FOUR Score was then incorporated into the ICH Score as a substitute for the GCS (ICH ScoreFS). The ability of the 2 scores to predict mortality at 1 month was then compared. Results In total, 274 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 73 years (interquartile range 60-82) and 138 (50.4\%) were male. Overall mortality at 1 month was 28.8\% (n\,=\,79). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was .91 for the ICH Score and .89 for the ICH ScoreFS. For ICH Scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, 1-month mortality was 4.2\%, 29.9\%, 62.5\%, 95.0\%, and 100\%. In the ICH ScoreFS model, mortality was 10.7\%, 26.5\%, 64.5\%, 88.9\%, and 100\% for scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Conclusions The ICH Score and the ICH ScoreFS predict 1-month mortality with comparable accuracy. As the FOUR Score provides additional clinical information regarding patient status, it may be a reasonable substitute for the GCS into the ICH Score.},

This concept suggested a relatively broad mean arterial pressure range (\textasciitilde 60\textendash\-150 mmHg) wherein cerebral blood flow remains constant. However, the assumption that this wide cerebral autoregulation plateau could be applied on a within-i\-ndividual basis is incorrect and greatly variable between individuals. Indeed, each data point on the autoregulatory curve originated from independent samples of participants and patients and represented interindividual relationships between cerebral blood flow and mean arterial pressure. Nonetheless, this influential concept remains commonly cited and illustrated in various high-\-impact publications and medical textbooks, and is frequently taught in medical and science education without appropriate nuances and caveats.},

Methods\textemdash{} A formal literature search of Medline was performed through the end date of August 2006. The results of this search were complemented by additional articles on related issues known to the writing committee. Data were synthesized with the use of evidence tables. The American Heart Association Stroke Council's Levels of Evidence grading algorithm was used to grade each recommendation. Prerelease review of the draft guideline was performed by 5 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council Leadership Committee. It is intended that this guideline be fully updated in 3 years' time. Results\textemdash{} Evidence-based guidelines are presented for the diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage, the management of increased arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure, the treatment of medical complications of intracerebral hemorrhage, and the prevention of recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage. Recent trials of recombinant factor VII to slow initial bleeding are discussed. Recommendations for various surgical approaches for treatment of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage are presented. Finally, withdrawal-of-care and end-of-life issues in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage are examined. (Stroke. 2007;38:2001-2023.)},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between serotonergic antidepressant exposure during pregnancy and child autism spectrum disorder. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study. Health administrative data sets were used to study children born to mothers who were receiving public prescription drug coverage during pregnancy in Ontario, Canada, from 2002-2010, reflecting 4.2\% of births. Children were followed up until March 31, 2014. EXPOSURES Serotonergic antidepressant exposure was defined as 2 or more consecutive maternal prescriptions for a selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor between conception and delivery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Child autism spectrum disorder identified after the age of 2 years. Exposure group differences were addressed by inverse probability of treatment weighting based on derived high-dimensional propensity scores (computerized algorithm used to select a large number of potential confounders) and by comparing exposed children with unexposed siblings. RESULTS There were 35 906 singleton births at a mean gestational age of 38.7 weeks (50.4\% were male, mean maternal age was 26.7 years, and mean duration of follow-up was 4.95 years). In the 2837 pregnancies (7.9\%) exposed to antidepressants, 2.0\% (95\% CI, 1.6\%-2.6\%) of children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The incidence of autism spectrum disorder was 4.51 per 1000 person-years among children exposed to antidepressants vs 2.03 per 1000 person-years among unexposed children (between-group difference, 2.48 [95\% CI, 2.33-2.62] per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 2.16 [95\% CI, 1.64-2.86]; adjusted HR, 1.59 [95\% CI, 1.17-2.17]). After inverse probability of treatment weighting based on the high-dimensional propensity score, the association was not significant (HR, 1.61 [95\% CI, 0.997-2.59]). The association was also not significant when exposed children were compared with unexposed siblings (incidence of autism spectrum disorder was 3.40 per 1000 person-years vs 2.05 per 1000 person-years, respectively; adjusted HR, 1.60 [95\% CI, 0.69-3.74]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In children born to mothers receiving public drug coverage in Ontario, Canada, in utero serotonergic antidepressant exposure compared with no exposure was not associated with autism spectrum disorder in the child. Although a causal relationship cannot be ruled out, the previously observed association may be explained by other factors.},

  abstract = {Objectives Locked-in syndrome (LIS) consists of anarthria and quadriplegia while consciousness is preserved. Classically, vertical eye movements or blinking allow coded communication. Given appropriate medical care, patients can survive for decades. We studied the self-reported quality of life in chronic LIS patients. Design 168 LIS members of the French Association for LIS were invited to answer a questionnaire on medical history, current status and end-of-life issues. They self-assessed their global subjective well-being with the Anamnestic Comparative Self-Assessment (ACSA) scale, whose +5 and -5 anchors were their memories of the best period in their life before LIS and their worst period ever, respectively. Results 91 patients (54\%) responded and 26 were excluded because of missing data on quality of life. 47 patients professed happiness (median ACSA +3) and 18 unhappiness (median ACSA -4). Variables associated with unhappiness included anxiety and dissatisfaction with mobility in the community, recreational activities and recovery of speech production. A longer time in LIS was correlated with happiness. 58\% declared they did not wish to be resuscitated in case of cardiac arrest and 7\% expressed a wish for euthanasia. Conclusions Our data stress the need for extra palliative efforts directed at mobility and recreational activities in LIS and the importance of anxiolytic therapy. Recently affected LIS patients who wish to die should be assured that there is a high chance they will regain a happy meaningful life. End-of-life decisions, including euthanasia, should not be avoided, but a moratorium to allow a steady state to be reached should be proposed.},

Teaching students to make more accurate probability estimates could improve the diagnostic process and, ultimately, the quality of medical care.To test whether novice clinicians can be taught to make more accurate bayesian revisions of diagnostic probabilities using teaching methods that apply either explicit conceptual instruction or repeated examples.A randomized clinical trial of 2 methods for teaching bayesian updating and diagnostic reasoning was performed. A web-based platform was used for consent, randomization, intervention, and testing of the effect of the intervention. Participants included 61 medical students at McMaster University and Eastern Virginia Medical School recruited from May 1 to September 30, 2018.Students were randomized to (1) receive explicit conceptual instruction regarding diagnostic testing and bayesian revision (concept group), (2) exposure to repeated examples of cases with feedback regarding posttest probability (experience group), or (3) a control condition with no conceptual instruction or repeated examples.Students in all 3 groups were tested on their ability to update the probability of a diagnosis based on either negative or positive test results. Their probability revisions were compared with posttest probability revisions that were calculated using the Bayes rule and known test sensitivity and specificity.Of the 61 participants, 22 were assigned to the concept group, 20 to the experience group, and 19 to the control group. Approximate age was 25 years. Two participants were first-year; 37, second-year; 12, third-year; and 10, fourth-year students. Mean (SE) probability estimates of students in the concept group were statistically significantly closer to calculated bayesian probability than the other 2 groups (concept, 0.4\%; [0.7\%]; experience, 3.5\% [0.7\%]; control, 4.3\% [0.7\%]; P\,\&lt;\,.001). Although statistically significant, the differences between groups were relatively modest, and students in all groups performed better than expected, based on prior reports in the literature.The study showed a modest advantage for students who received theoretical instruction on bayesian concepts. All participants' probability estimates were, on average, close to the bayesian calculation. These findings have implications for how to teach diagnostic reasoning to novice clinicians.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04130607},

The ACTIV Therapeutics-Clinical Working Group Agent Prioritization subgroup established a uniform data collection process required to perform an assessment of any agent type using review criteria that were identified and differentially weighted for each agent class. The ACTIV Therapeutics-Clinical Working Group evaluated over 750 therapeutic agents with potential application for coronavirus disease 2019 and prioritized promising candidates for testing within the master protocols conducted by ACTIV. In addition, promising agents among preclinical candidates were selected by ACTIV to be matched with laboratories that could assist in executing rigorous preclinical studies. Between April 14, 2020, and May 31, 2021, the Agent Prioritization subgroup advanced 20 agents into the Accelerating Coronavirus Disease 2019 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines master protocols and matched 25 agents with laboratories to assist with preclinical testing.},

When intercurrent events arise we stress the need to carefully define the target estimand and the importance of avoiding targets of inference that are not interpretable in the real world. This has implications for analyses, but also the design of clinical trials where protocols may help in the interpretation of estimands based on marginal features.},

This practice can lead to distorted effect-size estimates, inflated error rates, and other problems. We argue for the application of ordinal models that make appropriate assumptions about the variables under study. In this Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on opinions about stem-cell research and time courses of marriage. The appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the models and a discussion of censored ordinal models. Compared with metric models, ordinal models provide better theoretical interpretation and numerical inference from ordinal data, and we recommend their widespread adoption in psychology.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe practice variation in IMV discontinuation internationally, associations between initial discontinuation events and outcomes, and factors associated with the use of select discontinuation strategies and failed initial spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective, multinational, observational study of critically ill adults who received IMV for at least 24 hours from 142 intensive care units (ICUs) in 19 countries within 6 regions (27 in Canada, 23 in India, 22 in the UK, 26 in Europe, 21 in Australia/New Zealand, and 23 in the US). EXPOSURES Receiving IMV. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary analyses characterized types of initial IMV discontinuation events (extubation, SBT, or tracheostomy) and associations with clinical outcomes (including duration of ventilation, ICU and hospital mortality, and ICU and hospital length of stay). Secondary analyses examined the associations between SBT outcome and SBT timing and clinical outcomes. RESULTS Among 1868 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 61.8 [48.9-73.1] years; 1173 [62.8\%] men) 424 (22.7\%) underwent direct extubation, 930 (49.8\%) had an initial SBT (761 [81.8\%] successful), 150 (8.0\%) underwent direct tracheostomy, and 364 (19.5\%) died before a weaning attempt. Across regions, there was variation in the use of written directives to guide care, daily screening, SBT techniques, ventilator modes, and the roles played by clinicians involved in weaning. Compared with initial direct extubation, patients who had an initial SBT had higher ICU mortality (20 [4.7\%] vs 96 [10.3\%]; absolute difference, 5.6\% [95\% CI, 2.6\%-8.6\%]), longer duration of ventilation (median of 2.9 vs 4.1 days; absolute difference, 1.2 days [95\% CI, 0.7-1.6]), and longer ICU stay (median of 6.7 vs 8.1 days; absolute difference, 1.4 days [95\% CI, 0.8-2.4]). Patients whose initial SBT failed (vs passed) had higher ICU mortality (29 [17.2\%] vs 67 [8.8\%]; absolute difference, 8.4\% [95\% CI, 2.0\%-14.7\%]), longer duration of ventilation (median of 6.1 vs 3.5 days; absolute difference, 2.6 days [95\% CI, 1.6-3.6]), and longer ICU stay (median of 10.6 vs 7.7 days; absolute difference, 2.8 days [95\% CI, 1.1-5.2]). Compared with patients who underwent early initial SBTs, patients who underwent late initial SBTs ({$>$}2.3 days after intubation) had longer duration of ventilation (median of 2.1 vs 6.1 days; absolute difference, 4.0 days [95\% CI, 3.7-4.5]), longer ICU stay (median of 5.9 vs 10.8 days; absolute difference, 4.9 days [95\% CI, 4.0-6.3]), and longer hospital stay (median of 14.3 vs 22.8 days; absolute difference, 8.5 days [95\% CI, 6.0-11.0]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this observational study of invasive mechanical ventilation discontinuation in 142 ICUs in Canada, India, the UK, Europe, Australia/New Zealand, and the US from 2013 to 2016, weaning practices varied internationally.},

Methods: We assessed QOL in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA at 3 and 12 months postdischarge in the Adherence eValuation After Ischemic stroke\textendash Longitudinal Registry using the European Quality of Life\textendash 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) instrument. We generated multivariable linear regression models to evaluate the association between sex and EQ-5D while sequentially adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical, and stroke-related variables. We also used a proportional odds model to assess sex differences in the change in EQ-5D scores from 3 to 12 months. Correspondence to Dr. Bushnell: cbushnel@wakehealth.edu Results: A total of 1,370 patients were included, 53.7\% male, median age 65 years (interquartile range 56\textendash 77 years). Women had significantly lower QOL at 3 months (unadjusted EQ-5D 0.81 in women vs 0.84 in men; p , 0.001) and 12 months (0.83 vs men 0.84; p , 0.001) poststroke. After multivariable adjustment for sociodemographic, clinical, and stroke-related factors, women continued to have lower QOL at 3 months (mean difference 20.036; p 5 0.003) and at 12 months (mean difference 20.022; p 5 0.046). Women fared worse in the dimensions of mobility, pain/ discomfort, and anxiety/depression at 3 and 12 months. There were no sex differences in change in EQ-5D score from 3 to 12 months. Conclusion: Women have worse QOL than men up to 12 months after stroke, even after adjusting for important sociodemographic variables, stroke severity, and disability.

  abstract = {Background: Stroke remains a devastating complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which has persisted despite refinements in technique and increased operator experience. While cerebral embolic protection devices (EPDs) have been developed to mitigate this risk, data regarding their impact on stroke and other outcomes after TAVR are limited. Methods: We performed an observational study using data from the Society for Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry. Patients were included if they underwent elective or urgent transfemoral TAVR between January 2018 and December 2019. The primary outcome was in-hospital stroke. To adjust for confounding, the association between EPD use and clinical outcomes was evaluated using instrumental variable analysis, a technique designed to support causal inference from observational data, with site-level preference for EPD use within the same quarter of the procedure as the instrument. We also performed a propensity score\textendash based secondary analysis using overlap weights. Results: Our analytic sample included 123 186 patients from 599 sites. The use of EPD during TAVR increased over time, reaching 28\% of sites and 13\% of TAVR procedures by December 2019. There was wide variation in EPD use across hospitals, with 8\% of sites performing {$>$}50\% of TAVR procedures with an EPD and 72\% performing no procedures with an EPD in the last quarter of 2019. In our primary analysis using the instrumental variable model, there was no association between EPD use and in-hospital stroke (adjusted relative risk, 0.90 [95\% CI, 0.68\textendash 1.13]; absolute risk difference, -0.15\% [95\% CI, -0.49 to 0.20]). However, in our secondary analysis using the propensity score\textendash based model, EPD use was associated with 18\% lower odds of in-hospital stroke (adjusted odds ratio, 0.82 [95\% CI, 0.69\textendash 0.97]; absolute risk difference, -0.28\% [95\% CI, -0.52 to -0.03]). Results were generally consistent across the secondary end points, as well as subgroup analyses. Conclusions: In this nationally representative observational study, we did not find an association between EPD use for TAVR and in-hospital stroke in our primary instrumental variable analysis, and found only a modestly lower risk of in-hospital stroke in our secondary propensity-weighted analysis. These findings provide a strong basis for large-scale randomized, controlled trials to test whether EPDs provide meaningful clinical benefit for patients undergoing TAVR.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute blood pressure (BP) reduction aimed at attenuation of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) expansion might also compromise cerebral blood flow (CBF). We tested the hypothesis that CBF in acute ICH patients is unaffected by BP reduction. METHODS: Patients with spontaneous ICH {$<$}24 hours after onset and systolic BP {$>$} 150 mm Hg were randomly assigned to an intravenous antihypertensive treatment protocol targeting a systolic BP of {$<$}150 mm Hg (n=39) or {$<$}180 mm Hg (n=36). Patients underwent computed tomography perfusion imaging 2 hours postrandomization. The primary end point was perihematoma relative (relative CBF). RESULTS: Treatment groups were balanced with respect to baseline systolic BP: 182{$\pm$}20 mm Hg ({$<$}150 mm Hg target group) versus 184{$\pm$}25 mm Hg ({$<$}180 mm Hg target group; P=0.60), and for hematoma volume: 25.6{$\pm$}30.8 versus 26.9{$\pm$}25.2 mL (P=0.66). Mean systolic BP 2 hours after randomization was significantly lower in the {$<$}150 mm Hg target group (140{$\pm$}19 vs 162{$\pm$}12 mm Hg; P{$<$}0.001). Perihematoma CBF (38.7{$\pm$}11.9 mL/100 g per minute) was lower than in contralateral homologous regions (44.1{$\pm$}11.1 mL/100 g per minute; P{$<$}0.001) in all patients. The primary end point of perihematoma relative CBF in the {$<$}150 mm Hg target group (0.86{$\pm$}0.12) was not significantly lower than that in the {$<$}180 mm Hg group (0.89{$\pm$}0.09; P=0.19; absolute difference, 0.03; 95\% confidence interval -0.018 to 0.078). There was no relationship between the magnitude of BP change and perihematoma relative CBF in the {$<$}150 mm Hg (R=0.00005; 95\% confidence interval, -0.001 to 0.001) or {$<$}180 mm Hg target groups (R=0.000; 95\% confidence interval, -0.001 to 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid BP lowering after a moderate volume of ICH does not reduce perihematoma CBF. These physiological data indicate that acute BP reduction does not precipitate cerebral ischemia in ICH patients. Clinical Trial Registration Information- URL:http://clinicaltrials.gov.

Initial illness severity was based on coma and organ failure scores, presence of severe cerebral edema, and presence of highly malignant electroencephalogram (EEG) after resuscitation.TTM at 36 \textdegree C or 33 \textdegree C.Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge, and secondary outcomes were modified Rankin Scale and cerebral performance category.Among 1319 patients, 728 (55.2\%) had TTM at 33 \textdegree C (451 [62.0\%] men; median [interquartile range] age, 61 [50-72] years) and 591 (44.8\%) had TTM at 36 \textdegree C (353 [59.7\%] men; median [interquartile range] age, 59 [48-69] years). Overall, 184 of 187 patients (98.4\%) with severe cerebral edema died and 234 of 243 patients (96.3\%) with highly malignant EEG died regardless of TTM strategy. Comparing TTM at 33 \textdegree C with TTM at 36 \textdegree C in 911 patients (69.1\%) with neither severe cerebral edema nor highly malignant EEG, survival was lower in patients with mild to moderate coma and no shock (risk difference, \textendash 13.8\%; 95\% CI, \textendash 24.4\% to \textendash 3.2\%) but higher in patients with mild to moderate coma and cardiopulmonary failure (risk difference, 21.8\%; 95\% CI, 5.4\% to 38.2\%) or with severe coma (risk difference, 9.7\%; 95\% CI, 4.0\% to 15.3\%). Interactions were similar for functional outcomes. Most deaths (633 of 968 [65.4\%]) resulted after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies.In this study, TTM at 33 \textdegree C was associated with better survival than TTM at 36 \textdegree C among patients with the most severe post\textendash cardiac arrest illness but without severe cerebral edema or malignant EEG. However, TTM at 36 \textdegree C was associated with better survival among patients with mild- to moderate-severity illness.},

Patients were enrolled from December 2017 to July 2019 with follow-up until October 2019. Adult patients (N\,=\,300) with ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid, \textbackslash basilar, or middle cerebral artery were included less than 4.5 hours after symptom onset using standard intravenous thrombolysis eligibility criteria.Open-label tenecteplase at 0.40 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg; n\,=\,150) or 0.25 mg/kg (maximum, 25 mg; n\,=\,150) given as a bolus before endovascular thrombectomy.The primary outcome was reperfusion of greater than 50\% of the involved ischemic territory prior to thrombectomy, assessed by consensus of 2 blinded neuroradiologists. Prespecified secondary outcomes were level of disability at day 90 (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score; range, 0-6); mRS score of 0 to 1 (freedom from disability) or no change from baseline at 90 days; mRS score of 0 to 2 (functional independence) or no change from baseline at 90 days; substantial neurological improvement at 3 days; symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours; and all-cause death.All 300 patients who were randomized (mean age, 72.7 years; 141 [47\%] women) completed the trial. The number of participants with greater than 50\% reperfusion of the previously occluded vascular territory was 29 of 150 (19.3\%) in the 0.40 mg/kg group vs 29 of 150 (19.3\%) in the 0.25 mg/kg group (unadjusted risk difference, 0.0\% [95\% CI, -8.9\% to -8.9\%]; adjusted risk ratio, 1.03 [95\% CI, 0.66-1.61]; P\,=\,.89). Among the 6 secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences in any of the 4 functional outcomes between the 0.40 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg groups nor in all-cause deaths (26 [17\%] vs 22 [15\%]; unadjusted risk difference, 2.7\% [95\% CI, -5.6\% to 11.0\%]) or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7 [4.7\%] vs 2 [1.3\%]; unadjusted risk difference, 3.3\% [95\% CI, -0.5\% to 7.2\%]).Among patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke, a dose of 0.40 mg/kg, compared with 0.25 mg/kg, of tenecteplase did not significantly improve cerebral reperfusion prior to endovascular thrombectomy. The findings suggest that the 0.40-mg/kg dose of tenecteplase does not confer an advantage over the 0.25-mg/kg dose in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke in whom endovascular thrombectomy is planned.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03340493},

  abstract = {Intravenous thrombolytics and endovascular thrombectomy for ischemic stroke have evolved in parallel. However, the best approach to combine these reperfusion therapies in patients eligible for both strategies remains uncertain. Initial randomized trials of endovascular thrombectomy included administration of intravenous thrombolytics to all eligible patients. However, whether that is of net benefit has been questioned and parallels drawn with treatment of ST-segment\textendash elevation myocardial infarction, where intravenous thrombolytics are only given if first medical contact to percutaneous intervention is expected to be {$>$}90 minutes. Six randomized trials of a direct thrombectomy approach versus intravenous thrombolytics followed by endovascular thrombectomy have now reported their results. With exception of a minority of patients in one trial, the trials all used alteplase rather than potentially more effective tenecteplase. This review examines the current state of evidence and implications for clinical practice. Importantly, these trials only apply to patients who present to a hospital with immediate access to endovascular thrombectomy and are not relevant to patients who receive thrombolytic and are then transferred to an endovascular-capable hospital. Although 2 of the 6 randomized trials met their prespecified noninferiority margin, these margins were large compared with the absolute benefit of alteplase. Overall, functional outcome was similar, with slight trends favoring bridging thrombolytics and a significant increase in final reperfusion. Symptomatic hemorrhage was increased by {$\approx$}1.8\% in the bridging group but death was nonsignificantly lower. The workflow in direct thrombectomy trials involved delaying thrombolytic administration until eligibility for thrombectomy and the trials was established and randomization completed. This reduced the time available for thrombolytics to occur prethrombectomy compared with standard practice. We conclude that, pending individual-patient data meta-analyses, intravenous thrombolytics retain an important role alongside endovascular thrombectomy. Further efforts to accelerate and enhance reperfusion with thrombolytics and perform individual patient-level pooled subgroup analyses are warranted.},

For practitioners, the framework, illustrative examples and code should equip them with a practical approach to address the issues raised by missing data (particularly using multiple imputation), alongside an overview of how the various approaches in the literature relate. In particular, we describe how multiple imputation can be readily used for sensitivity analyses, which are still infrequently performed. For those interested in more formal derivations, we give outline arguments for key results, use simple examples to show how methods relate, and references for full details. The ideas are illustrated with a cohort study, a multi-centre case control study and a randomised clinical trial.},

Users of SoF tables have demanded alternative formats to express findings from systematic reviews. Study Design and Setting: We conducted a randomized controlled trial among systematic review users to compare the relative merits of a new format with the current formats of SoF tables regarding understanding, accessibility of information, satisfaction, and preference. Our primary goal was to show that the new format is not inferior to the current format. Results: Of 390 potentially eligible subjects, 290 were randomized. Of seven items testing understanding, three showed similar results, two showed small differences favoring the new format, and two (understanding risk difference and quality of the evidence associated with a treatment effect) showed large differences favoring the new format [63\% (95\% confidence interval \{CI\}: 55, 71) and 62\% (95\% CI: 52, 71) more correct answers, respectively]. Respondents rated information in the alternative format as more accessible overall and preferred the new format over the current format. Conclusions: While providing at least similar levels of understanding for some items and increased understanding for others, users prefer the new format of SoF tables. \'O 2016 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet treatment remains the first choice for primary and secondary prevention of vascular diseases; even so, expected benefits may be offset by risk of bleeding, particularly cerebral hemorrhage. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of antiplatelet treatment on clinical outcome at hospital discharge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with first-ever stroke due to a primary intraparenchymal hemorrhage were prospectively identified over a 4-year period (2000-2003). Data on hemorrhage location, vascular risk factors, and antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment were collected. At discharge, outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale (disabling stroke {$>$} or =3). Patients treated with anticoagulant therapy were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Of 457 consecutive patients with cerebral hemorrhage, 94 (20.5\%) had been taking antiplatelet agents. The treated patients (mean age for antiplatelet group 78.9 +/- 9.0 years) were older than the nontreated patients (73.8 +/- 9.4, p = 0.02). In-hospital mortality was 23.4 and 23.1\% (p = n.s.) for patients who had been taking antiplatelet agents or no treatment. Poor outcome at discharge was found in 52.1 and 59.7\% (p = n.s.), respectively. Univariate analysis showed that age and coma at admission were predictors of disability at discharge, but antiplatelet treatment was not. Additionally, age and coma were shown to be determinants of disability at discharge after multivariate analysis: OR 1.03 per year (95\% CI: 1.018-1.049), p {$<$} 0.001 and OR 1.68 (95\% CI: 1.138-2.503), p = 0.009, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic stroke continues to be responsible for a high percentage of disability and death. Furthermore, it was seen here that functional outcome was independent of previous antiplatelet treatment.},

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shone a light on this need. The literature on nutrition and COVID-19 mainly focuses on the importance of nutrition to preserve life and prevent clinical deterioration during the acute phase of illness. However, there is a lack of information guiding practice across the whole patient journey (e.g., hospital to home) with a focus on targeting recovery (e.g., long COVID). This review paper is of relevance to doctors and other healthcare professionals in acute care and primary care worldwide, since it addresses early, multi-modal individualised nutrition interventions across the continuum of care to improve COVID-19 patient outcomes. It is of relevance to nutrition experts and non-nutrition experts and can be used to promote inter-professional and inter-organisational knowledge transfer on the topic. The primary goal is to prevent complications and support recovery to enable COVID-19 patients to achieve the best possible nutritional, physical, functional and mental health status and to apply the learning to date from the COVID-19 pandemic to other patient groups experiencing acute severe illness.},

We evaluated differences in patient-level sedation and analgesia dosing in an international multicenter TTM trial to better characterize current practice and clinically important outcomes. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} A total 950 patients in the international TTM trial were randomly assigned to a TTM of 33 \textdegree C or 36 \textdegree C after resuscitation from cardiac arrest in 36 intensive care units. We recorded cumulative doses of sedative and analgesic drugs at 12, 24, and 48 h and normalized to midazolam and fentanyl equivalents. We compared number of medications used, dosing, and titration among centers by using multivariable models, including common severity of illness factors. We also compared dosing with time to awakening, incidence of clinical seizures, and survival. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 614 patients at 18 centers were analyzed. Propofol (70\%) and fentanyl (51\%) were most frequently used. The average dosages of midazolam and fentanyl equivalents were 0.13 (0.07, 0.22) mg/kg/h and 1.16 (0.49, 1.81) \textmu g/kg/h, respectively. There were significant differences in number of medications (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), average dosages (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and titration at all time points between centers (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and the outcomes of patients in these centers were associated with all parameters described in the multivariate analysis, except for a difference in the titration of sedatives between 12 and 24 h (p\,=\,0.40). There were associations between higher dosing at 48 h (p\,=\,0.003, odds ratio [OR] 1.75) and increased titration of analgesics between 24 and 48 h (p\,=\,0.005, OR 4.89) with awakening after 5 days, increased titration of sedatives between 24 and 48 h with awakening after 5 days (p\,{$<$}\,0.001, OR\,{$>$}\,100), and increased titration of sedatives between 24 and 48 h with a higher incidence of clinical seizures in the multivariate analysis (p\,=\,0.04, OR 240). There were also significant associations between decreased titration of analgesics and survival at 6 months in the multivariate analysis (p\,=\,0.048). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} There is significant variation in choice of drug, dosing, and titration when providing sedation and analgesics between centers. Sedation and analgesia dosing and titration were associated with delayed awakening, incidence of clinical seizures, and survival, but the causal relation of these findings cannot be proven.},

When study units are clustered (eg, patients nested within health systems), additional challenges arise such as accounting for unmeasured confounding at multiple levels and dependence between units within the same cluster. While clustered observational data are widely used to draw causal inferences in many fields, including medicine and healthcare, extensions of propensity score methods to clustered settings are still a relatively new area of research. This article presents a framework for estimating causal effects using propensity scores when study units are nested within clusters and are nonrandomly assigned to treatment conditions. We emphasize the need for investigators to examine the nature of the clustering, among other properties, of the observational data at hand in order to guide their choice of causal estimands and the corresponding propensity score approach.},

  abstract = {Background Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an age-related small vessel disease, characterised pathologically by progressive deposition of amyloid {$\beta$} in the cerebrovascular wall. The Boston criteria are used worldwide for the in-vivo diagnosis of CAA but have not been updated since 2010, before the emergence of additional MRI markers. We report an international collaborative study aiming to update and externally validate the Boston diagnostic criteria across the full spectrum of clinical CAA presentations. Methods In this multicentre, hospital-based, retrospective, MRI and neuropathology diagnostic accuracy study, we did a retrospective analysis of clinical, radiological, and histopathological data available to sites participating in the International CAA Association to formulate updated Boston criteria and establish their diagnostic accuracy across different populations and clinical presentations. Ten North American and European academic medical centres identified patients aged 50 years and older with potential CAA-related clinical presentations (ie, spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, cognitive impairment, or transient focal neurological episodes), available brain MRI, and histopathological assessment for CAA diagnosis. MRI scans were centrally rated at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA, USA) for haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic CAA markers, and brain tissue samples were rated by neuropathologists at the contributing sites. We derived the Boston criteria version 2.0 (v2.0) by selecting MRI features to optimise diagnostic specificity and sensitivity in a prespecified derivation cohort (Boston cases 1994\textendash 2012, n=159), then externally validated the criteria in a prespecified temporal validation cohort (Boston cases 2012\textendash 18, n=59) and a geographical validation cohort (non-Boston cases 2004\textendash 18; n=123), comparing accuracy of the new criteria to the currently used modified Boston criteria with histopathological assessment of CAA as the diagnostic standard. We also assessed performance of the v2.0 criteria in patients across all cohorts who had the diagnostic gold standard of brain autopsy. Findings The study protocol was finalised on Jan 15, 2017, patient identification was completed on Dec 31, 2018, and imaging analyses were completed on Sept 30, 2019. Of 401 potentially eligible patients presenting to Massachusetts General Hospital, 218 were eligible to be included in the analysis; of 160 patient datasets from other centres, 123 were included. Using the derivation cohort, we derived provisional criteria for probable CAA requiring the presence of at least two strictly lobar haemorrhagic lesions (ie, intracerebral haemorrhages, cerebral microbleeds, or foci of cortical superficial siderosis) or at least one strictly lobar haemorrhagic lesion and at least one white matter characteristic (ie, severe visible perivascular spaces in centrum semiovale or white matter hyperintensities in a multispot pattern). The sensitivity and specificity of these criteria were 74{$\cdot$}8\% (95\% CI 65{$\cdot$}4\textendash 82{$\cdot$}7) and 84{$\cdot$}6\% (71{$\cdot$}9\textendash 93{$\cdot$}1) in the derivation cohort, 92{$\cdot$}5\% (79{$\cdot$}6\textendash 98{$\cdot$}4) and 89{$\cdot$}5\% (66{$\cdot$}9\textendash 98{$\cdot$}7) in the temporal validation cohort, 80{$\cdot$}2\% (70{$\cdot$}8\textendash 87{$\cdot$}6) and 81{$\cdot$}5\% (61{$\cdot$}9\textendash 93{$\cdot$}7) in the geographical validation cohort, and 74{$\cdot$}5\% (65{$\cdot$}4\textendash 82{$\cdot$}4) and 95{$\cdot$}0\% (83{$\cdot$}1\textendash 99{$\cdot$}4) in all patients who had autopsy as the diagnostic standard. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0{$\cdot$}797 (0{$\cdot$}732\textendash 0{$\cdot$}861) in the derivation cohort, 0{$\cdot$}910 (0{$\cdot$}828\textendash 0{$\cdot$}992) in the temporal validation cohort, 0{$\cdot$}808 (0{$\cdot$}724\textendash 0{$\cdot$}893) in the geographical validation cohort, and 0{$\cdot$}848 (0{$\cdot$}794\textendash 0{$\cdot$}901) in patients who had autopsy as the diagnostic standard. The v2.0 Boston criteria for probable CAA had superior accuracy to the current Boston criteria (sensitivity 64{$\cdot$}5\% [54{$\cdot$}9\textendash 73{$\cdot$}4]; specificity 95{$\cdot$}0\% [83{$\cdot$}1\textendash 99{$\cdot$}4]; AUC 0{$\cdot$}798 [0{$\cdot$}741\textendash 0854]; p=0{$\cdot$}0005 for comparison of AUC) across all individuals who had autopsy as the diagnostic standard. Interpretation The Boston criteria v2.0 incorporate emerging MRI markers of CAA to enhance sensitivity without compromising their specificity in our cohorts of patients aged 50 years and older presenting with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, cognitive impairment, or transient focal neurological episodes. Future studies will be needed to determine generalisability of the v.2.0 criteria across the full range of patients and clinical presentations.

  abstract = {Purpose:\hspace{0.6em} Corticosteroids are now recommended for patients with severe COVID-19 including those with COVIDrelated ARDS. This has generated renewed interest regarding whether corticosteroids should be used in non-COVID ARDS as well. The objective of this study was to summarize all RCTs examining the use of corticosteroids in ARDS. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} The protocol of this study was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020200659). We searched online databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CDC library of COVID research, CINAHL, and COCHRANE. We included RCTs that compared the effect of corticosteroids to placebo or usual care in adult patients with ARDS, including patients with COVID-19. Three reviewers abstracted data independently and in duplicate using a pre-specified standardized form. We assessed individual study risk of bias using the revised Cochrane ROB-2 tool and rated certainty in outcomes using GRADE methodology. We pooled data using a random effects model. The main outcome for this review was 28-day-mortality. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We included 18 RCTs enrolling 2826 patients. The use of corticosteroids probably reduced mortality in patients with ARDS of any etiology (2740 patients in 16 trials, RR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.72\textendash 0.95, ARR 8.0\%, 95\% CI 2.2\textendash 12.5\%, moderate certainty). Patients who received a longer course of corticosteroids (over 7 days) had higher rates of survival compared to a shorter course. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} The use of corticosteroids probably reduces mortality in patients with ARDS. This effect was consistent between patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS, corticosteroid types, and dosage.},

Similarly, significant decreases in monocyte/macrophage infiltration, complement levels, and other markers of inflammation in the injured kidney are observed across multiple studies and species. In essence, decreased renal clearance has the surprising and counterintuitive effect of being an effective treatment for AKI. In this Perspective, the author suggests a hypothesis describing why the uremic milieu is kidney protective and proposes a clinical trial of `permissive azotemia' to improve renal recovery and long-term renal outcomes in critically ill patients with severe AKI.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Stroke has been reported in observational series as a frequent complication of coronavirus disease 2019, but more information is needed regarding stroke prevalence and outcomes. We explored the prevalence and outcomes of acute stroke in an international cohort of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who required ICU admission. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected database. SETTING: A registry of coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to ICUs at over 370 international sites was reviewed for patients diagnosed with acute stroke during their stay. PATIENTS: Patients older than 18 years old with acute coronavirus disease 2019 infection in ICU. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 2,699 patients identified (median age 59 yr; male 65\%), 59 (2.2\%) experienced acute stroke: 0.7\% ischemic, 1.0\% hemorrhagic, and 0.5\% unspecified type. Systemic anticoagulant use was not associated with any stroke type. The frequency of diabetes, hypertension, and smoking was higher in patients with ischemic stroke than in stroke-free and hemorrhagic stroke patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was more common among patients with hemorrhagic (56\%) and ischemic stroke (16\%) than in those without stroke (10\%). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients had higher cumulative 90-day probabilities of hemorrhagic (relative risk = 10.5) and ischemic stroke (relative risk = 1.7) versus nonextracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. Hemorrhagic stroke increased the hazard of death (hazard ratio = 2.74), but ischemic stroke did not\textemdash similar to the effects of these stroke types seen in noncoronavirus disease 2019 ICU patients. CONCLUSIONS: In an international registry of ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019, stroke was infrequent. Hemorrhagic stroke, but not ischemic stroke, was associated with increased mortality. Further, both hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke were associated with traditional vascular risk factors. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use was strongly associated with both stroke and death.},

  abstract = {cal trials and evidence to date, prognostic considerations, controversies, recent developments, and future directions in SAH. RECENT FINDINGS  Historically, management of SAH focused on prevention and treatment of subsequent cerebral vasospasm, which was thought to be the primary cause of delayed cerebral ischemia. Clinical and translational studies over the past decade, including several therapeutic phase 3 randomized clinical trials, suggest that the pathophysiology of SAH-associated brain injury is multiphasic and multifactorial beyond large vessel cerebral vasospasm. The quest to reduce SAH-associated brain injury and improve outcomes is shifting away from large vessel cerebral vasospasm to a new paradigm targeting multiple brain injury mechanisms, including early brain injury, delayed cerebral ischemia, microcirculatory dysfunction, spreading cortical depolarization, inflammation, and the brain-body interaction in vascular brain injury with critical illness. Despite multiple negative randomized clinical trials in search of potential therapeutic agents ameliorating the downstream effects after SAH, the overall outcome of SAH has improved over recent decades, likely related to improvements in interventional options for ruptured cerebral aneurysms and in critical care management. Emerging clinical evidence also suggests potential harmful impact of historic empiric treatments for SAH-associated vasospasm, such as prophylactic induction of hypertension, hypervolemia, and hemodilution (triple H therapy). With decreasing mortality, long-term SAH survivorship and efforts to reduce chronic morbidity and to improve quality of life and patient-centered outcome are growing areas of unmet need. Despite existing guidelines, significant variabilities in local and regional practices and in scientific terminologies have historically limited advancement in SAH care and therapeutic development. Large global collaborative efforts developed harmonized SAH common data elements in 2019, and studies are under way to examine how existing variabilities in SAH care impact long-term SAH outcomes. SUMMARY  Although the overall incidence and mortality of SAH is decreasing with advances in preventive and acute care, SAH remains a major cause of long-term morbidity in survivors. Significant variabilities in care settings and empiric treatment protocols and inconsistent scientific terminologies have limited advancement in patient care and therapeutic clinical studies. Large consensus efforts are under way to introduce clinical guidelines and common data elements to advance therapeutic approaches and improve patient outcome....},

  abstract = {Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterized by excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Central DI results from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, whereas nephrogenic DI results from resistance to AVP in the kidneys. Central and nephrogenic DI are usually acquired, but genetic causes must be evaluated, especially if symptoms occur in early childhood. Central or nephrogenic DI must be differentiated from primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action. Primary polydipsia is most common in psychiatric patients and health enthusiasts but the polydipsia in a small subgroup of patients seems to be due to an abnormally low thirst threshold, a condition termed dipsogenic DI. Distinguishing between the different types of DI can be challenging and is done either by a water deprivation test or by hypertonic saline stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. Furthermore, a detailed medical history{$\mkern1mu$}, physical examination and imaging studies are needed to ensure an accurate DI diagnosis. Treatment of DI or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and differs in central DI, nephrogenic DI and primary polydipsia.},

It has been claimed to be ``easy to understand'' and gives ``intuitive meaning''. When used to measure the effectiveness of interventions targeting chronic disease processes e.g. atherosclerosis and osteoporosis, NNT (as well as relative and absolute risk reduction) does not capture the crucial time component, a fact that has important consequences: NNT varies over time, it may not mean that adverse events (fractures, myocardial infarctions etc.) are avoided, but simply that they are postponed. Finally, empirical studies indicate that lay people and doctors misunderstand NNT. We recommend that NNT be used with considerable care. There is probably no single effect measure that is able to convey all necessary information.},

This may be caused by potentially neurotoxic anaesthetic drugs, impaired cerebral perfusion and reperfusion injury related to surgery or thromboembolic events. Patient monitoring using electroencephalogram and cerebral oximetry can assist in optimising depth of anaesthesia and assessment of cerebral metabolic activity. However, research findings have been contradictory as to whether these monitors can help ameliorate peri-operative neurocognitive complications. In this narrative review, we will discuss recent evidence in the use of electroencephalography and cerebral oximetry and the underlying scientific principles. It is important to appreciate the raw electroencephalographic changes under anaesthesia and those associated with ageing, in order to interpret depth of anaesthesia indices correctly. Cerebral oximetry is useful not only for the detection of cerebral desaturation but also to identify those patients who are particularly vulnerable to injury, for better risk stratification. An algorithm-based approach may be most effective in managing the episodes of cerebral desaturation.},

Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. We have found that the cases presented here can serve as a powerful instructional device to supplement more extended and formal discussions of the problem.

This finding withstood adjustment for variation in vaping rates among states. The cross-sectional nature of the analysis and inherent limitations of the available data mean that the ecological fallacy and other sources of confounding may be at play. In part because of its preliminary nature, interesting questions arise from the analysis, answers to which are likely to ultimately be found at the intersection of sociology, public health, and the law. It is illuminating to examine some of these questions through a wide historical lens.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Secondary analysis of CENTER-TBI, a multicentre, prospective, observational, cohort study. The primary aim was to describe current practice in \-PaCO2 management during the first week of intensive care unit (ICU) after TBI, focusing on the lowest \-PaCO2 values. We also assessed \-PaCO2 management in patients with and without ICP monitoring \-(ICPm), and with and without intracranial hypertension. We evaluated the effect of profound hyperventilation (defined as \-PaCO2\,{$<$}\,30 mmHg) on long-term outcome. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We included 1100 patients, with a total of 11,791 measurements of \-PaCO2 (5931 lowest and 5860 highest daily values). The mean ({$\pm$}\, SD) \-PaCO2 was 38.9 ({$\pm$}\,5.2) mmHg, and the mean minimum \-PaCO2 was 35.2 ({$\pm$}\,5.3) mmHg. Mean daily minimum P\- aCO2 values were significantly lower in the \-ICPm group (34.5 vs 36.7 mmHg, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Daily \-PaCO2 nadir was lower in patients with intracranial hypertension (33.8 vs 35.7 mmHg, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Considerable heterogeneity was observed between centers. Management in a centre using profound hyperventilation (HV) more frequently was not associated with increased 6 months mortality (OR\,=\,1.06, 95\% CI\,=\,0.77\textendash 1.45, p value\,=\,0.7166), or unfavourable neurological outcome (OR 1.12, 95\% CI\,=\,0.90\textendash 1.38, p value = 0.3138). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Ventilation is manipulated differently among centers and in response to intracranial dynamics. P\- aCO2 tends to be lower in patients with ICP monitoring, especially if ICP is increased. Being in a centre which more frequently uses profound hyperventilation does not affect patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Brain function critically depends on a close matching between metabolic demands, appropriate delivery of oxygen and nutrients, and removal of cellular waste. This matching requires continuous regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), which can be categorized into four broad topics: 1) autoregulation, which describes the response of the cerebrovasculature to changes in perfusion pressure; 2) vascular reactivity to vasoactive stimuli [including carbon dioxide (CO )]; 3) neurovascular coupling (NVC), i.e., the CBF response to local changes in neural activity (often stan2dardized cognitive stimuli in humans); and 4) endothelium-dependent responses. This review focuses primarily on autoregulation and its clinical implications. To place autoregulation in a more precise context, and to better understand integrated approaches in the cerebral circulation, we also briefly address reactivity to CO and NVC. In addition to our focus on effects of perfusion pressure (or blood pressure), we describe the i2mpact of select stimuli on regulation of CBF (i.e., arterial blood gases, cerebral metabolism, neural mechanisms, and specific vascular cells), the interrelationships between these stimuli, and implications for regulation of CBF at the level of large arteries and the microcirculation. We review clinical implications of autoregulation in aging, hypertension, stroke, mild cognitive impairment, anesthesia, and dementias. Finally, we discuss autoregulation in the context of common daily physiological challenges, including changes in posture (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, syncope) and physical activity.},

  abstract = {Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is the third most common subtype of stroke. Incidence has decreased over past decades, possibly in part related to lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation and management of hypertension. Approximately a quarter of patients with SAH die before hospital admission; overall outcomes are improved in those admitted to hospital, but with elevated risk of long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae such as depression. The disease continues to have a major public health impact as the mean age of onset is in the mid-fifties, leading to many years of reduced quality of life. The clinical presentation varies, but severe, sudden onset of headache is the most common symptom, variably associated with meningismus, transient or prolonged unconsciousness, and focal neurological deficits including cranial nerve palsies and paresis. Diagnosis is made by CT scan of the head possibly followed by lumbar puncture. Aneurysms are commonly the underlying vascular cause of spontaneous SAH and are diagnosed by angiography. Emergent therapeutic interventions are focused on decreasing the risk of rebleeding (ie, preventing hypertension and correcting coagulopathies) and, most crucially, early aneurysm treatment using coil embolisation or clipping. Management of the disease is best delivered in specialised intensive care units and high-volume centres by a multidisciplinary team. Increasingly, early brain injury presenting as global cerebral oedema is recognised as a potential treatment target but, currently, disease management is largely focused on addressing secondary complications such as hydrocephalus, delayed cerebral ischaemia related to microvascular dysfunction and large vessel vasospasm, and medical complications such as stunned myocardium and hospital acquired infections.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Data on the occurrence times of multiple outcomes, reflecting the temporal profile of disease burden/progression, have been used to estimate treatment effects in various recent randomized trials. Most procedures for analyzing these data require specific model assumptions. When the assumptions are not met, the results may be misleading. Robust, model-free procedures for study design and analysis that enable clinically meaningful interpretations are warranted. METHODS For each treatment group, we constructed and summarized the estimated mean cumulative count of events over time by the area under the curve (AUC), which can be interpreted as the mean total event-free time lost from multiple undesirable outcomes. A higher curve, and resulting larger AUC, implies a worse treatment. The treatment effect is quantified by the ratio and/or difference of AUCs. The timing and occurrence of recurrent heart failure hospitalizations (HFHs) and cardiovascular (CV) death from Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ARB Global Outcomes in HF with Preserved Ejection Fraction (PARAGON-HF), comparing sacubitril/valsartan with valsartan, are presented for illustration. We also discuss the design of future studies on the basis of the proposed method. RESULTS With 48 months of follow-up, estimated AUCs, representing the total event-free time lost to HFHs and CV death, were 11.3 and 13.1 event-months for sacubitril/valsartan and valsartan, respectively. The ratio of these AUCs was 0.86 (95\% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.00; P=0.049), a 14\% reduction of disease burden favoring combination therapy. A future study, similar to PARAGON-HF, designed using the new proposal would require fewer patients would than a conventional time-to-first-event analysis. CONCLUSIONS The proposed method is robust and model-free and provides a clinically interpretable, time-scale summary of the treatment effect. (Funded by National Institutes of Health.)},

This research investigated the complexity of factors that influence quality of life after stroke, using qualitative interviews. Results indicate that a stroke has a significant impact on the quality of life of survivors, but some individuals find ways to adapt to their functional disabilities and report a high quality of life. Common elements of this process consist of reordering priorities to focus on those activities considered most salient to an individual's identity; then drawing on existing resources, including health services and social supports, to maintain a customary activity, even in a modified form, retaining salient aspects of the individual's identity and maintaining a sense of continuity in his or her life.},

DESIGN: Retrospective review of patient data from the prospective, randomized, multicenter National Acute Brain Injury Study: Hypothermia, comparing outcome results at 6 months after injury with intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and fluid balance measurements recorded during the 96-hr period after randomization. SETTING: Emergency departments and intensive care units in 11 metropolitan tertiary care university hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 392 patients, aged 16-65 yrs, with severe, nonpenetrating brain injuries and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3-8 after resuscitation, who were enrolled in a study designed to determine the treatment effect of moderate hypothermia in patients with severe brain injury. INTERVENTION: Standard brain injury treatment for 193 randomly assigned patients and standard treatment plus hypothermia for 48 hrs for 199 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intracranial pressure levels of 20, 25, and 30 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure levels of 70 and 80 mm Hg, cerebral perfusion pressure levels of 50, 60, and 70 mm Hg, and fluid balance levels in quartiles were examined for their effect on outcome as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months after injury. When considered separately, any of the following-intracranial pressure {$>$}25 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure {$<$}70 mm Hg, or cerebral perfusion pressure {$<$}60 mm Hg and fluid balance lower than -594 mL-was associated with an increased percentage of patients with poor outcome. When the variables were combined into a stepwise logistic regression model, Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission, age, mean arterial pressure {$<$}70 mm Hg, fluid balance lower than -594 mL, and intracranial pressure {$>$} 25 mm Hg, in that order, were the most powerful variables in determining outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Exceeding thresholds of intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and fluid volume may be detrimental to severe brain injury outcome. Fluid balance lower than -594 mL was associated with an adverse effect on outcome, independent of its relationship to intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, or cerebral perfusion pressure.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Observational studies of interventions are at risk for confounding by indication. The objective of the current study was to define the circumstances for the validity of methods to adjust for confounding by indication in observational studies. Patients and methods: We performed post hoc analyses of data prospectively collected from three European and North American traumatic brain injury studies including 1,725 patients. The effects of three interventions (intracranial pressure [ICP] monitoring, intracranial operation and primary referral) were estimated in a proportional odds regression model with the Glasgow Outcome Scale as ordinal outcome variable. Three analytical methods were compared: classical covariate adjustment, propensity score matching and instrumental variable (IV) analysis in which the percentage exposed to an intervention in each hospital was added as an independent variable, together with a random intercept for each hospital. In addition, a simulation study was performed in which the effect of a hypothetical beneficial intervention (OR 1.65) was simulated for scenarios with and without unmeasured confounders. Results: For all three interventions, covariate adjustment and propensity score matching resulted in negative estimates of the treatment effect (OR ranging from 0.80 to 0.92), whereas the IV approach indicated that both ICP monitoring and intracranial operation might be beneficial (OR per 10\% change 1.17, 95\% CI 1.01\textendash 1.42 and 1.42, 95\% CI 0.95\textendash 1.97). In our simulation study, we found that covariate adjustment and propensity score matching resulted in an invalid estimate of the treatment effect in case of unmeasured confounders (OR ranging from 0.90 to 1.03). The IV approach provided an estimate in the similar direction as the simulated effect (OR per 10\% change 1.04\textendash 1.05) but was statistically inefficient. Conclusion: The effect estimation of interventions in observational studies strongly depends on the analytical method used. When unobserved confounding and practice variation are expected in observational multicenter studies, IV analysis should be considered.},

  abstract = {Purpose of the Review To evaluate the quality of evidence about the association of primary seizure prophylaxis with antiseizure medication (ASM) within 7 days postinjury and the 18- or 24-month epilepsy/late seizure risk or all-cause mortality in adults with new-onset traumatic brain injury (TBI), in addition to early seizure risk. Results Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria (7 randomized and 16 nonrandomized studies). We analyzed 9,202 patients, including 4,390 in the exposed group and 4,812 in the unexposed group (894 in placebo and 3,918 in no ASM groups). There was a moderate to serious bias risk based on our assessment. Within the limitations of existing studies, our data revealed a lower risk for early seizures in the ASM prophylaxis group compared with placebo or no ASM prophylaxis (risk ratio [RR] 0.43, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.33\textendash 0.57, p {$<$} 0.00001, I2 = 3\%). We identified high-quality evidence in favor of acute, short-term primary ASM use to prevent early seizures. Early ASM prophylaxis was not associated with a substantial difference in the 18- or 24-month risk of epilepsy/late seizures (RR 1.01, 95\% CI 0.61\textendash 1.68, p = 0.96, I2 = 63\%) or mortality (RR 1.16, 95\% CI 0.89\textendash 1.51, p = 0.26, I2 = 0\%). There was no evidence of strong publication bias for each main outcome. The overall quality of evidence was low and moderate for post-TBI epilepsy risk and all-cause mortality, respectively. Summary Our data suggest that the evidence showing no association between early ASM use and 18- or 24-month epilepsy risk in adults with new-onset TBI was of low quality. The analysis indicated a moderate quality for the evidence showing no effect on all-cause mortality. Therefore, higher-quality evidence is needed as a supplement for stronger recommendations.},

Design, Setting, and Patients:~         Refractory cardiogenic shock is almost always lethal without emergency circulatory support, e.g., ECMO. ECMO-associated morbidity and mortality plead for identification of early predictors of its failure, and detailed analyses of short- and long-term outcomes to refine patient selection and improve results. Outcomes of 81 patients given ECMO support for medical (n = 55), postcardiotomy (n = 16), or posttransplantation (n = 10) cardiogenic shock were evaluated.         Measurements and Main Results:~         Thirty-four (42\%) patients survived to hospital discharge; 57\% suffered {$\geq$}1 major ECMO-related complications. Independent predictors of intensive care unit death were: device insertion under cardiac massage (odds ratio [OR] = 20.68), 24 hr urine output {$<$}500 mL (OR = 6.52), prothrombin activity {$<$}50\% (OR = 3.93), and female sex (OR = 3.89); myocarditides were associated with better outcomes (OR = .13). Sequelae and health-related quality-of-life were evaluated for 28 long-term survivors (median follow-up, 11 months), whose mean Short-Form 36 scores were significantly lower than matched healthy controls for physical role, general health, and social functioning, but higher than those reported for patients on chronic hemodialysis, with advanced heart failure, or after recovery from acute respiratory distress syndrome.         Conclusions:~         ECMO support can rescue 40\% of otherwise fatal cardiogenic shock patients but its initiation under cardiac massage or after renal or hepatic failure carried higher risks of intensive care unit death, while fulminant myocarditis had a better prognosis. Despite satisfactory mental health and vitality, long-term survivors' persistent physical and social problems might benefit from tailored medical or psychosocial interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Andexanet alfa (andexanet) is a recombinant modified human factor Xa decoy protein that has been shown to reverse the inhibition of factor Xa in healthy volunteers. METHODS In this multicenter, prospective, open-label, single-group study, we evaluated 67 patients who had acute major bleeding within 18 hours after the administration of a factor Xa inhibitor. The patients all received a bolus of andexanet followed by a 2-hour infusion of the drug. Patients were evaluated for changes in measures of anti\textendash factor Xa activity and were assessed for clinical hemostatic efficacy during a 12-hour period. All the patients were subsequently followed for 30 days. The efficacy population of 47 patients had a baseline value for anti\textendash factor Xa activity of at least 75 ng per milliliter (or {$\geq$}0.5 IU per milliliter for those receiving enoxaparin) and had confirmed bleeding severity at adjudication. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 77 years; most of the patients had substantial cardiovascular disease. Bleeding was predominantly gastrointestinal or intracranial. The mean ({$\pm$}SD) time from emergency department presentation to the administration of the andexanet bolus was 4.8{$\pm$}1.8 hours. After the bolus administration, the median anti\textendash factor Xa activity decreased by 89\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 58 to 94) from baseline among patients receiving rivaroxaban and by 93\% (95\% CI, 87 to 94) among patients receiving apixaban. These levels remained similar during the 2-hour infusion. Four hours after the end of the infusion, there was a relative decrease from baseline of 39\% in the measure of anti\textendash factor Xa activity among patients receiving rivaroxaban and of 30\% among those receiving apixaban. Twelve hours after the andexanet infusion, clinical hemostasis was adjudicated as excellent or good in 37 of 47 patients in the efficacy analysis (79\%; 95\% CI, 64 to 89). Thrombotic events occurred in 12 of 67 patients (18\%) during the 30-day follow-up.

  abstract = {Background Warfarin reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but increases the risk of hemorrhage and is difficult to use. Dabigatran is a new oral direct thrombin inhibitor. Methods In this noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned 18,113 patients who had atrial fibrillation and a risk of stroke to receive, in a blinded fashion, fixed doses of dabigatran \textemdash{} 110 mg or 150 mg twice daily \textemdash{} or, in an unblinded fashion, adjusted-dose warfarin. The median duration of the follow-up period was 2.0 years. The primary outcome was stroke or systemic embolism. Results Rates of the primary outcome were 1.69\% per year in the warfarin group, as compared with 1.53\% per year in the group that received 110 mg of dabigatran (relative risk with dabigatran, 0.91; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.11; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority) and 1.11\% per year in the group that received 150 mg of dabigatran (relative risk, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.82; P{$<$}0.001 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 3.36\% per year in the warfarin group, as compared with 2.71\% per year in the group receiving 110 mg of dabigatran (P\,=\,0.003) and 3.11\% per year in the group receiving 150 mg of dabigatran (P\,=\,0.31). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.38\% per year in the warfarin group, as compared with 0.12\% per year with 110 mg of dabigatran (P{$<$}0.001) and 0.10\% per year with 150 mg of dabigatran (P{$<$}0.001). The mortality rate was 4.13\% per year in the warfarin group, as compared with 3.75\% per year with 110 mg of dabigatran (P\,=\,0.13) and 3.64\% per year with 150 mg of dabigatran (P\,=\,0.051). Conclusions In patients with atrial fibrillation, dabigatran given at a dose of 110 mg was associated with rates of stroke and systemic embolism that were similar to those associated with warfarin, as well as lower rates of major hemorrhage. Dabigatran administered at a dose of 150 mg, as compared with warfarin, was associated with lower rates of stroke and systemic embolism but similar rates of major hemorrhage.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Andexanet alfa is a modified recombinant inactive form of human factor Xa developed for reversal of factor Xa inhibitors. METHODS We evaluated 352 patients who had acute major bleeding within 18 hours after administration of a factor Xa inhibitor. The patients received a bolus of andexanet, followed by a 2-hour infusion. The coprimary outcomes were the percent change in anti\textendash factor Xa activity after andexanet treatment and the percentage of patients with excellent or good hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours after the end of the infusion, with hemostatic efficacy adjudicated on the basis of prespecified criteria. Efficacy was assessed in the subgroup of patients with confirmed major bleeding and baseline anti\textendash factor Xa activity of at least 75 ng per milliliter (or {$\geq$}0.25 IU per milliliter for those receiving enoxaparin). RESULTS Patients had a mean age of 77 years, and most had substantial cardiovascular disease. Bleeding was predominantly intracranial (in 227 patients [64\%]) or gastrointestinal (in 90 patients [26\%]). In patients who had received apixaban, the median anti\textendash factor Xa activity decreased from 149.7 ng per milliliter at baseline to 11.1 ng per milliliter after the andexanet bolus (92\% reduction; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 91 to 93); in patients who had received rivaroxaban, the median value decreased from 211.8 ng per milliliter to 14.2 ng per milliliter (92\% reduction; 95\% CI, 88 to 94). Excellent or good hemostasis occurred in 204 of 249 patients (82\%) who could be evaluated. Within 30 days, death occurred in 49 patients (14\%) and a thrombotic event in 34 (10\%). Reduction in anti\textendash factor Xa activity was not predictive of hemostatic efficacy overall but was modestly predictive in patients with intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS In patients with acute major bleeding associated with the use of a factor Xa inhibitor, treatment with andexanet markedly reduced anti\textendash factor Xa activity, and 82\% of patients had excellent or good hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours, as adjudicated according to prespecified criteria.

Methods\textemdash A formal literature search of MEDLINE (November 1, 2006, through May 1, 2010) was performed. Data were synthesized with the use of evidence tables. Writing group members met by teleconference to discuss data-derived recommendations. The American Heart Association Stroke Council's Levels of Evidence grading algorithm was used to grade each recommendation. The guideline draft was reviewed by 7 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council Leadership and Manuscript Oversight Committees. It is intended that this guideline be fully updated every 3 years. Results\textemdash Evidence-based guidelines are presented for the care of patients presenting with aSAH. The focus of the guideline was subdivided into incidence, risk factors, prevention, natural history and outcome, diagnosis, prevention of rebleeding, surgical and endovascular repair of ruptured aneurysms, systems of care, anesthetic management during repair, management of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia, management of hydrocephalus, management of seizures, and management of medical complications. Conclusions\textemdash aSAH is a serious medical condition in which outcome can be dramatically impacted by early, aggressive, expert care. The guidelines offer a framework for goal-directed treatment of the patient with aSAH. (Stroke. 2012;43:1711-1737.)},

Results: The trial design is compared to a trial without adaptive randomization and produces an efficient trial in which a higher proportion of patients are likely to be randomized to the most effective treatment arm while generally using fewer total patients and offers higher power than an analogous trial with fixed randomization when identifying a superior treatment. Conclusion: When one treatment is superior to the other two, the trial design provides better patient care, higher power, and a lower expected sample size. \'O 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The first description of fluids for resuscitation of a critically ill patient occurred during the 1830s cholera outbreak in England. In the 200 years since, debates continue surrounding the volume, composition, and rate of fluid administration, with few definitive answers to guide clinicians.Previous studies have demonstrated that mortality is decreased when critically ill patients receive early fluid resuscitation during septic shock and hemorrhagic shock, although studies exploring the rate of fluid resuscitation have largely been absent. Although there is some intuitive appeal to rapid resuscitation in an underresuscitated patient, the potential benefits may be counterbalanced by concerns that overly rapid fluid administration may impair right ventricular function, worsen tissue edema, and decrease organ function.},

  abstract = {Background The randomised controlled trial (RCT) is widely considered to be the gold standard study for comparing the effectiveness of health interventions. Central to the design and validity of a RCT is a calculation of the number of participants needed (the sample size). The value used to determine the sample size can be considered the `target difference'. From both a scientific and an ethical standpoint, selecting an appropriate target difference is of crucial importance. Determination of the target difference, as opposed to statistical approaches to calculating the sample size, has been greatly neglected though a variety of approaches have been proposed the current state of the evidence is unclear. Objectives The aim was to provide an overview of the current evidence regarding specifying the target difference in a RCT sample size calculation. The specific objectives were to conduct a systematic review of methods for specifying a target difference; to evaluate current practice by surveying triallists; to develop guidance on specifying the target difference in a RCT; and to identify future research needs. Design The biomedical and social science databases searched were MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process \& Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Methodology Register, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index, EconLit, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Scopus for in-press publications. All were searched from 1966 or the earliest date of the database coverage and searches were undertaken between November 2010 and January 2011. There were three interlinked components: (1) systematic review of methods for specifying a target difference for RCTs \textendash{} a comprehensive search strategy involving an electronic literature search of biomedical and some non-biomedical databases and clinical trials textbooks was carried out; (2) identification of current trial practice using two surveys of triallists \textendash{} members of the Society for Clinical Trials (SCT) were invited to complete an online survey and respondents were asked about their awareness and use of, and willingness to recommend, methods; one individual per triallist group [UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC)-registered Clinical Trials Units (CTUs), Medical Research Council (MRC) UK Hubs for Trials Methodology Research and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) UK Research Design Services (RDS)] was invited to complete a survey; (3) production of a structured guidance document to aid the design of future trials \textendash{} the draft guidance was developed utilising the results of the systematic review and surveys by the project steering and advisory groups. Setting Methodological review incorporating electronic searches, review of books and guidelines, two surveys of experts (membership of an international society and UK- and Ireland-based triallists) and development of guidance. Participants The two surveys were sent out to membership of the SCT and UK- and Ireland-based triallists. Interventions The review focused on methods for specifying the target difference in a RCT. It was not restricted to any type of intervention or condition. Main outcome measures Methods for specifying the target difference for a RCT were considered. Results The search identified 11,485 potentially relevant studies. In total, 1434 were selected for full-text assessment and 777 were included in the review. Seven methods to specify the target difference for a RCT were identified \textendash{} anchor, distribution, health economic, opinion-seeking, pilot study, review of evidence base (RoEB) and standardised effect size (SES) \textendash{} each having important variations in implementation. A total of 216 of the included studies used more than one method. A total of 180 (15\%) responses to the SCT survey were received, representing 13 countries. Awareness of methods ranged from 38\% (n = 69) for the health economic method to 90\% (n = 162) for the pilot study. Of the 61 surveys sent out to UK triallist groups, 34 (56\%) responses were received. Awareness ranged from 97\% (n = 33) for the RoEB and pilot study methods to only 41\% (n = 14) for the distribution method. Based on the most recent trial, all bar three groups (91\%, n = 30) used a formal method. Guidance was developed on the use of each method and the reporting of the sample size calculation in a trial protocol and results paper. Conclusions There is a clear need for greater use of formal methods to determine the target difference and better reporting of its specification. Raising the standard of RCT sample size calculations and the corresponding reporting of them would aid health professionals, patients, researchers and funders in judging the strength of the evidence and ensuring better use of scarce resources.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Randomised controlled trials are considered to be the best method to assess comparative clinical efficacy and effectiveness, and can be a key source of data for estimating cost effectiveness. Central to the design of a randomised controlled trial is an a priori sample size calculation, which ensures that the study has a high probability of achieving its prespecified main objective. Beyond pure statistical or scientific concerns, it is ethically imperative that an appropriate number of study participants be recruited, to avoid imposing the burdens of a clinical trial on more patients than necessary. The scientific concern is satisfied and the ethical imperative is further addressed by the specification of a target difference between treatments that is considered realistic or important by one or more key stakeholder groups. The sample size calculation ensures that the trial will have the required statistical power to identify whether a difference of a particular magnitude exists. In this article, the key messages from the DELTA\textsuperscript{2} guidance on determining the target difference and sample size calculation for a randomised controlled trial are presented.

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Acute treatment of cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure is a common issue in patients with neurological injury. Practical recommendations regarding selection and monitoring of therapies for initial management of cerebral edema for optimal efficacy and safety are generally lacking. This guideline evaluates the role of hyperosmolar agents (mannitol, HTS), corticosteroids, and selected non-pharmacologic therapies in the acute treatment of cerebral edema. Clinicians must be able to select appropriate therapies for initial cerebral edema management based on available evidence while balancing efficacy and safety. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} The Neurocritical Care Society recruited experts in neurocritical care, nursing, and pharmacy to create a panel in 2017. The group generated 16 clinical questions related to initial management of cerebral edema in various neurological insults using the PICO format. A research librarian executed a comprehensive literature search through July 2018. The panel screened the identified articles for inclusion related to each specific PICO question and abstracted necessary information for pertinent publications. The panel used GRADE methodology to categorize the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on their confidence that the findings of each publication approximate the true effect of the therapy. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The panel generated recommendations regarding initial management of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, bacterial meningitis, and hepatic encephalopathy. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} The available evidence suggests hyperosmolar therapy may be helpful in reducing ICP elevations or cerebral edema in patients with SAH, TBI, AIS, ICH, and HE, although neurological outcomes do not appear to be affected. Corticosteroids appear to be helpful in reducing cerebral edema in patients with bacterial meningitis, but not ICH.},

In patients from the Saline vs. Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) study with TBI who underwent intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, interventional data were collected from randomization to day 14 to determine changes in ICP (primary outcome) and in therapies used to treat increased ICP. Pattern mixture modelling, designed to address informative dropouts, was used to compare temporal changes between the albumin and saline groups, and 321 patients were identified, of whom 164 (51.1\%) received albumin and 157 (48.9\%) received saline. There was a significant linear increase in mean ICP and significantly more deaths in the albumin group compared with saline when ICP monitoring was discontinued during the first week (1.30{$\pm$}0.33 vs. -0.37{$\pm$}0.36, p=0.0006; and 34.4\% vs. 17.4\%; p=0.006 respectively), but not when monitoring ceased during the second week (-0.08{$\pm$}0.44 vs. -0.23{$\pm$}0.38, p=0.79; and 18.6\% vs. 12.1\%; p=0.36 respectively). There were statistically significant differences in the mean total daily doses of morphine (-0.42{$\pm$}0.07 vs. -0.66{$\pm$}0.0, p=0.0009), propofol (-0.45{$\pm$}0.11 vs. -0.76{$\pm$}0.11; p=0.034) and norepinephrine (-0.50{$\pm$}0.07 vs. -0.74{$\pm$}0.07) and in temperature (0.03{$\pm$}0.03 vs. 0.16{$\pm$}0.03; p=0.0014) between the albumin and saline groups when ICP monitoring ceased during the first week. The use of albumin for resuscitation in patients with severe TBI is associated with increased ICP during the first week. This is the most likely mechanism of increased mortality in these patients.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose: Thirty-day mortality rates in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) range from 35\% to 50\%, with only 10\textendash 20\% of the survivors regaining functional independence. This high mortality and morbidity argues for the optimization of emergency medical services (EMS), emergency department (ED), and in-patient treatment paradigms. With the development of interventional strategies for ICH, both pharmacologic and surgical, time to treatment will be critical to improving outcomes. Similar to acute ischemic stroke care, proper preparation and role definition will be critical for efficient evaluation and treatment. We studied the existence and structure of ICH management protocols in US hospitals. Methods: A national survey of Emergency Medicine physicians was conducted to gather information regarding the existence of stroke and ICH treatment protocols at their institutions. Results: A clearly established pathway for the management of ischemic stroke exists in most hospitals (78\%). By contrast, only 30\% of hospitals have a clearly defined pathway for ICH. Thus, while most hospitals are able to perform rapid computed tomography (CT) scans to diagnose ICH, the management of these patients post-CT is more fragmented and variable. Few hospitals have comprehensive protocols that include treatment policies for raised intracranial pressure or formal policies for the transfer of patients to centers with neurocritical care/neurosurgical resources. Recommendations: Integration of ICH critical pathways into stroke protocols could potentially improve the high mortality and disability associated with this condition and might facilitate ongoing studies of ICH-specific interventions. With stroke neurologists and neurocritical care specialists showing an increasing interest in ICH management, development of critical pathways may allow for a standardized approach to best treatment practices within institutions and networks as evidence grows for new treatments and management strategies. This may also allow a redefinition of the roles of team members, including ED and critical care physicians, neurologists, and neurosurgeons.}

We measured quantitative lung computed tomography, esophageal pressure swings and total lung stress. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Patients were divided in five subgroups based on their baseline \-PaO2/FiO2 (day 1): non-CARDS (median \-PaO2/FiO2 361 mmHg, IQR [323\textendash 379]), mild (224 mmHg [211\textendash 249]), mild-moderate (173 mmHg [164\textendash 185]), moderate-severe (126 mmHg [114\textendash 138]) and severe (88 mmHg [86\textendash 99], p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Each subgroup had similar median lung weight: 1215 g [1083\textendash 1294], 1153 [888\textendash 1321], 968 [858\textendash 1253], 1060 [869\textendash 1269], and 1127 [937\textendash 1193] (p\,=\,0.37). They also had similar non-aerated tissue fraction: 10.4\% [5.9\textendash 13.7], 9.6 [7.1\textendash 15.8], 9.4 [5.8\textendash 16.7], 8.4 [6.7\textendash 12.3] and 9.4 [5.9\textendash 13.8], respectively (p\,=\,0.85). Treatment failure of CPAP/NIV occurred in 34 patients (24.3\%). Only three variables, at day one, distinguished patients with negative outcome: \-PaO2/FiO2 ratio (OR 0.99 [0.98\textendash 0.99], p\,=\,0.02), esophageal pressure swing (OR 1.13 [1.01\textendash 1.27], p\,=\,0.032) and total stress (OR 1.17 [1.06\textendash 1.31], p\,=\,0.004). When these three variables were evaluated together in a multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the total stress was independently associated with negative outcome (OR 1.16 [1.01\textendash 1.33], p\,=\,0.032). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} In early COVID-19 pneumonia, hypoxemia is not linked to computed tomography (CT) pathoanatomy, differently from typical ARDS. High lung stress was independently associated with the failure of non-invasive respiratory support.},

In the greater Boston area, only two school districts \textemdash{} the Boston and neighboring Chelsea districts \textemdash{} sustained masking requirements through June 2022. The staggered lifting of masking requirements provided an opportunity to examine the effect of universal masking policies on the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in schools. METHODS We used a difference-in-differences analysis for staggered policy implementation to compare the incidence of Covid-19 among students and staff in school districts in the greater Boston area that lifted masking requirements with the incidence in districts that sustained masking requirements during the 2021\textendash 2022 school year. Characteristics of the school districts were also compared. From the Fran\c{c}ois\textendash Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights, Harvard T.H.

Chan School of Public Health, 651 Huntington Ave., Boston, MA 02115. RESULTS Before the statewide masking policy was rescinded, trends in the incidence of Covid-19 were similar across school districts. During the 15 weeks after the statewide masking policy was rescinded, the lifting of masking requirements was associated with an additional 44.9 cases per 1000 students and staff (95\% confidence interval, 32.6 to 57.1), which corresponded to an estimated 11,901 cases and to 29.4\% of the cases in all districts during that time. Districts that chose to sustain masking requirements longer tended to have school buildings that were older and in worse condition and to have more students per classroom than districts that chose to lift masking requirements earlier. In addition, these districts had higher percentages of low-income students, students with disabilities, and students who were English-language learners, as well as higher percentages of Black and Latinx students and staff. Our results support universal masking as an important strategy for reducing Covid-19 incidence in schools and loss of in-person school days. As such, we believe that universal masking may be especially useful for mitigating effects of structural racism in schools, including potential deepening of educational inequities.

CONCLUSIONS Among school districts in the greater Boston area, the lifting of masking requirements was associated with an additional 44.9 Covid-19 cases per 1000 students and staff during the 15 weeks after the statewide masking policy was rescinded.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Determining the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is essential for evaluating novel therapies. For acute ischemic stroke, expert surveys have yielded MCIDs that are substantially higher than the MCIDs observed in actual expert behavior in guideline writing and clinical practice, potentially because of anchoring bias. Methods\textemdash We administered a structured, internet-based survey to a cross-section of academic stroke neurologists in the United States. Survey responses assessed demographic and clinical experience, and expert judgment of the MCID of the absolute increase needed in the proportion of patients achieving functional independence at 3 months to consider a novel, safe neuroprotective agent as clinically worthwhile. To mitigate anchoring bias, the survey response framework used a base 1000 rather than base 100 patient framework. Results\textemdash Survey responses were received from 122 of 333 academic stroke neurologists, there were 23\% women, 72.8\% had {$\geq$}6 years of practice experience, and neurovascular disease accounted for more than half of practice time in {$>$}70\%. Responder\textendash nonresponder and continuum of resistance tests indicated that responders were representative of the full expert population. Among respondents, the median MCID was 1.3\% (interquartile range, 0.8\% to {$>$}2\%). Conclusions\textemdash Stroke expert responses to MCID surveys are affected by anchoring and centrality bias. When survey design takes these into account, the expert-derived MCID for a safe acute ischemic stroke treatment is 1.1\% to 1.5\%, in accord with actual physician behavior in guideline writing and clinical practice. This revised MCID value can guide clinical trial design and grant-funding and regulatory agency decisions.\hspace{0.6em}\,{$\mkern1mu$}(Stroke. 2017;48:2946-2951.

Their urgent deployment was defended with modelling and observational data of spurious credibility. There is major debate on whether these measures are effective and there is also uncertainty about the magnitude of the harms that these measures might induce. Given that there is equipoise for how, when and if specific social distancing interventions for COVID-19 should be applied and removed/modified during reopening, we argue that informative randomised-controlled trials are needed. Only a few such randomised trials have already been conducted, but the ones done to-date demonstrate that a randomised trials agenda is feasible. We discuss here issues of study design choice, selection of comparators (intervention and controls), choice of outcomes and additional considerations for the conduct of such trials. We also discuss and refute common counter-arguments against the conduct of such trials.},

  abstract = {Objectives To evaluate how often the precise research question being addressed about an intervention (the estimand) is stated or can be determined from reported methods, and to identify what types of questions are being investigated in phase 2-4 randomised trials. Design Systematic review of the clarity of research questions being investigated in randomised trials in 2020 in six leading general medical journals. Data source PubMed search in February 2021. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Phase 2-4 randomised trials, with no restrictions on medical conditions or interventions. Cluster randomised, crossover, non-inferiority, and equivalence trials were excluded. Main outcome measures Number of trials that stated the precise primary question being addressed about an intervention (ie, the primary estimand), or for which the primary estimand could be determined unambiguously from the reported methods using statistical knowledge. Strategies used to handle post-randomisation events that affect the interpretation or existence of patient outcomes, such as intervention discontinuations or uses of additional drug treatments (known as intercurrent events), and the corresponding types of questions being investigated. Results 255 eligible randomised trials were identified. No trials clearly stated all the attributes of the estimand. In 117 (46\%) of 255 trials, the primary estimand could be determined from the reported methods. Intercurrent events were reported in 242 (95\%) of 255 trials; but the handling of these could only be determined in 125 (49\%) of 255 trials. Most trials that provided this information considered the occurrence of intercurrent events as irrelevant in the calculation of the treatment effect and assessed the effect of the intervention regardless (96/125, 77\%)\textemdash that is, they used a treatment policy strategy. Four (4\%) of 99 trials with treatment non-adherence owing to adverse events estimated the treatment effect in a hypothetical setting (ie, the effect as if participants continued treatment despite adverse events), and 19 (79\%) of 24 trials where some patients died estimated the treatment effect in a hypothetical setting (ie, the effect as if participants did not die). Conclusions The precise research question being investigated in most trials is unclear, mainly because of a lack of clarity on the approach to handling intercurrent events. Clear reporting of estimands is necessary in trial reports so that all stakeholders, including clinicians, patients and policy makers, can make fully informed decisions about medical interventions.

A major limitation of current meta-analysis techniques is their inability to pool ordinal data. Our objectives were to determine the extent of this problem in the context of neurological rating scales and to provide a solution. Methods Using an existing database of clinical trials of oral neuroprotective therapies, we identified the 6 most commonly used clinical rating scales and recorded how data from these scales were reported and analysed. We then identified systematic reviews of studies that used these scales (via the Cochrane database) and recorded the meta-analytic techniques used. Finally, we identified a statistical technique for calculating a common language effect size measure for ordinal data. Results We identified 103 studies, with 128 instances of the 6 clinical scales being reported. The majority\textendash{} 80\%\textendash reported means alone for central tendency, with only 13\% reporting medians. In analysis, 40\% of studies used parametric statistics alone, 34\% of studies employed non-parametric analysis, and 26\% did not include or specify analysis. Of the 60 systematic reviews identified that included meta-analysis, 88\% used mean difference and 22\% employed difference in proportions; none included rank-based analysis. We propose the use of a rank-based generalised odds ratio (WMW GenOR) as an assumptionfree effect size measure that is easy to compute and can be readily combined in metaanalysis. Conclusion There is wide scope for improvement in the reporting and analysis of ordinal data in the literature. We hope that adoption of the WMW GenOR will have the dual effect of improving the},

Critical care clinicians' decisions regarding mechanical ventilation and related treatments such as level of sedation might have more profound and far-reaching residual effects than has been previously recognized. To deliver effective, cost-effective, and patient-centered care, critical-care clinicians must consider outcomes other than survival.

The treated and non-treated (that is, control) groups may have large differences on their observed covariates, and these differences can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects. Even traditional covariance analysis adjustments may be inadequate to eliminate this bias. The propensity score, defined as the conditional probability of being treated given the covariates, can be used to balance the covariates in the two groups, and therefore reduce this bias. In order to estimate the propensity score, one must model the distribution of the treatment indicator variable given the observed covariates. Once estimated the propensity score can be used to reduce bias through matching, stratification (subclassification), regression adjustment, or some combination of all three. In this tutorial we discuss the uses of propensity score methods for bias reduction, give references to the literature and illustrate the uses through applied examples. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

ICU mortality for the intervention and control periods were 399 (23.5\%) and 330 (21.2\%), respectively (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.13; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 1.54; P\,=\,0.46). Time to IVACs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.06; 95\% CI 0.44 to 2.57; P\,=\,0.90), time to extubation (aHR 1.03; 95\% CI 0.85 to 1.23; P\,=\,0.79) (survivors) and oral procedural pain (aOR, 0.62; 95\% CI 0.34 to 1.10; P\,=\,0.10) were similar between control and intervention periods. However, oral health dysfunction scores (-\,0.96; 95\% CI\,-\,1.75 to\,-\,0.17; P\,=\,0.02) improved in the intervention period. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Among mechanically ventilated ICU patients, no benefit was observed for de-adoption of chlorhexidine and implementation of an oral care bundle on ICU mortality, IVACs, oral procedural pain, or time to extubation. The intervention may improve oral health.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE\hspace{0.6em} Being overweight or mildly obese has been associated with a decreased risk of death or hospitalization in patients with cardiovascular disease. Similarly, overweight patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) have improved survival up to 1 year after admission. These counterintuitive observations are examples of the ``obesity paradox.'' Does the obesity paradox exist in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)? In this study the authors examined whether there was an association between obesity and functional outcome in patients with ICH. METHODS\hspace{0.6em} The authors analyzed 202 patients admitted to the neurological ICU (NICU) who were prospectively enrolled in the Columbia University ICH Outcomes Project between September 2009 and December 2012. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: overweight (body mass index [BMI] {$\geq$} 25 kg/m2) and not overweight (BMI {$<$} 25 kg/m2). The primary outcome was defined as survival with favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0\textendash 3) versus death or severe disability (mRS score 4\textendash 6) at 3 months. RESULTS\hspace{0.6em} The mean age of the patients in the study was 61 years. The mean BMI was 28 {$\pm$} 6 kg/m2. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale score was 10 {$\pm$} 4 and the mean ICH score was 1.9 {$\pm$} 1.3. The overall 90-day mortality rate was 41\%. Among patients with a BMI {$<$} 25 kg/m2, 24\% (17/70) had a good outcome, compared with 39\% (52/132) among those with a BMI {$\geq$} 25 kg/m2 (p = 0.03). After adjusting for ICH score, sex, do-not-resuscitate code status, and history of hypertension, being overweight or obese (BMI {$\geq$} 25 kg/m2) was associated with twice the odds of having a good outcome compared with patients with BMI {$<$} 25 kg/m2 (adjusted odds ratio 2.05, 95\% confidence interval 1.03\textendash 4.06, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS\hspace{0.6em} In patients with ICH admitted to the NICU, being overweight or obese (BMI {$\geq$} 25 kg/m2) was associated with favorable outcome after adjustment for established predictors. The reason for this finding requires further study. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2017.5.JNS163266 KEY WORDS\hspace{0.6em} intracerebral hemorrhage; obesity; functional recovery; intensive care unit; vascular disorders},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Surgical clipping and endovascular treatment are commonly used in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms. We compared the safety and efficacy of the 2 treatments in a randomized trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clipping or endovascular treatments were randomly allocated to patients with one or more 3- to 25-mm unruptured intracranial aneurysms judged treatable both ways by participating physicians. The study hypothesized that clipping would decrease the incidence of treatment failure from 13\% to 4\%, a composite primary outcome defined as failure of aneurysm occlusion, intracranial hemorrhage during follow-up, or residual aneurysms at 1 year, as adjudicated by a core lab. Safety outcomes included new neurologic deficits following treatment, hospitalization of {$>$}5 days, and overall morbidity and mortality (mRS {$>$} 2) at 1 year. There was no blinding. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-one patients were enrolled from 2010 to 2020 in 7 centers. The 1-year primary outcome, ascertainable in 290/291 (99\%) patients, was reached in 13/142 (9\%; 95\% CI, 5\%\textendash 15\%) patients allocated to surgery and in 28/148 (19\%; 95\% CI, 13\%\textendash 26\%) patients allocated to endovascular treatments (relative risk: 2.07; 95\% CI, 1.12\textendash 3.83; P = .021). Morbidity and mortality (mRS {$>$}2) at 1 year occurred in 3/143 and 3/148 (2\%; 95\% CI, 1\%\textendash 6\%) patients allocated to surgery and endovascular treatments, respectively. Neurologic deficits (32/143, 22\%; 95\% CI, 16\%\textendash 30\% versus 19/148, 12\%; 95\% CI, 8\%\textendash 19\%; relative risk: 1.74; 95\% CI, 1.04\textendash 2.92; P = .04) and hospitalizations beyond 5 days (69/143, 48\%; 95\% CI, 40\%\textendash 56\% versus 12/148, 8\%; 95\% CI, 5\%\textendash 14\%; relative risk: 0.18; 95\% CI, 0.11\textendash 0.31; P {$<$} .001) were more frequent after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical clipping is more effective than endovascular treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in terms of the frequency of the primary outcome of treatment failure. Results were mainly driven by angiographic results at 1 year.},

The decision of whether and when to resume anticoagulation following intracranial hemorrhage is challenging and requires an assessment of associated risks and benefits. Clinical data, imaging, and risk factors for both ischemic and hemorrhagic complications may aid in decision-making. Baseline functional status, life expectancy, compliance with therapy, and family support also impact decision analyses. Currently available data suggest that anticoagulation could be safely restarted in select groups of OAC-ICH patients within 4~weeks of intracranial hemorrhage; however, high-quality randomized, clinical trials are needed.},

  abstract = {Purpose Little is known about how physicians discuss prognosis with terminally ill cancer patients. Thus, we sought to obtain cancer physicians' self-reports of their prognosis communication practices. Methods A survey seeking self-reports regarding prognosis communication with their terminally ill cancer patients was mailed to a systematic sample of medical oncologists in the United States. Results Of 1,137 physicians, 729 completed and returned surveys (64\% response rate). Median age of respondents was 51 years (range, 33 to 80 years); 82\% were men. Respondents had practiced cancer care for a median of 18 years (range, 1.5 to 50 years) and reported seeing a median of 60 patients per week (range, 0 to 250 patients per week). Although 98\% said their usual practice is to tell terminally ill patients that they will die, 48\% specifically described communicating terminal prognoses to patients only when specific preferences for prognosis information were expressed. Forty-three percent said they always or usually communicate a medical estimate of time as to when death is likely to occur, and 57\% reported sometimes, rarely, or never giving a time frame. Seventy-three percent said prognosis communication education was either absent or inadequate during their training, and 96\% believed it should be part of cancer care training. Conclusion Medical oncologists report routinely informing their terminally ill patients that they will die. However, they are divided in describing themselves as either always discussing a terminal prognosis or doing so if it is consistent with their patients' preferences for prognostic information. Most medical oncologists say they do not routinely communicate an estimated survival time to their patients.},

These dogmas are based on uncontrolled case series from \&gt;50 years ago, amplified by the opinions of eminent experts. Conversely, more than 120 modern, randomized controlled trials have established that shorter durations of therapy are equally effective for many infections. Furthermore, 21 concordant randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that oral antibiotic therapy is at least as effective as IV-only therapy for osteomyelitis, bacteremia, and endocarditis. Nevertheless, practitioners in many clinical settings remain refractory to adopting these changes. It is time for Infectious Diseases to move beyond its history of eminent opinion-based medicine and truly into the era of evidenced-based medicine.},

Although on Oxford `A' REC (an NHS Research Ethics Committee based in the UK) we've been impressed by the thought and work put into this aspect of research ethics, we've continued to have concerns about the suitability and effectiveness of consent processes in supporting decision making, particularly for clinical trials. There's poor understanding of what people want to help them decide; current processes don't provide the best grounding for informed consent and there's inadequate public involvement. We've also found a lack of proportionality with researchers failing to adapt consent procedures in proportion to the burdens and consequences of the study. As a result, people are often not best helped to make an informed choice when asked to join a research study. To address these concerns, we considered how we might improve this aspect of research ethics review. Recognising the central importance of the dialogue between the volunteer and researcher, we've drawn up a model or flowchart of what we deem good consent practice, proposing consent should be built around four simple steps:             Step 1: Introducing the study and the choices: helping the potential participants get an overview of the proposal and introducing the key issues.             Step 2: Explaining all the details of the study using the detailed Participant Information Sheet.             Step 3: After a gap, if necessary, reviewing and checking understanding.             Step 4: Reaching agreement and recording consent.             These steps, we believe, could help all involved and this article lays out ways we might improve participant choice while complying with accepted principles and current regulations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to examine whether hospitalization for pneumonia is associated with functional decline, cognitive impairment, and depression, and to compare this impairment with that seen after known disabling conditions, such as myocardial infarction or stroke. METHODS: We used data from a prospective cohort of 1434 adults aged more than 50 years who survived 1711 hospitalizations for pneumonia, myocardial infarction, or stroke drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (1998-2010). Main outcome measures included the number of Activities and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living requiring assistance and the presence of cognitive impairment and substantial depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Hospitalization for pneumonia was associated with 1.01 new impairments in Activities and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-1.32) among patients without baseline functional impairment and 0.99 new impairments in Activities and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (95\% CI, 0.57-1.41) among those with mild-to-moderate baseline limitations, as well as moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment (odds ratio, 2.46; 95\% CI, 1.60-3.79) and substantial depressive symptoms (odds ratio, 1.63; 95\% CI, 1.06-2.51). Patients without baseline functional impairment who survived pneumonia hospitalization had more subsequent impairments in Activities and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living than those who survived myocardial infarction hospitalization. There were no significant differences in subsequent moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment or substantial depressive symptoms between patients who survived myocardial infarction or stroke and those who survived pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization for pneumonia in older adults is associated with subsequent functional and cognitive impairment.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is associated with high mortality and morbidity. We aimed to determine the relative benefits of pharmacological prophylactic treatments in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage by performing a network meta-analysis of randomized trials. METHODS: We searched Medline, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest, and Cochrane Central to February 2020. Pairs of reviewers independently identified eligible trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Eligible trials compared the prophylactic effects of any oral or intravenous medications or intracranial drug-eluting implants to one another or placebo or standard of care in adult hospitalized patients with confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. We used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. RESULTS: We included 53 trials enrolling 10\,415 patients. Nimodipine likely reduces all-cause mortality compared to placebo (odds ratio [OR],0.73 [95\% CI, 0.53\textendash 1.00]; moderate certainty; absolute risk reduction (ARR), -3.35\%). Nimodipine (OR, 1.46 [95\% CI, 1.07\textendash 1.99]; high certainty; absolute risk increase, 8.25\%) and cilostazol (OR, 3.73 [95\% CI, 1.14\textendash 12.18]; moderate certainty; absolute risk increase, 23.15\%) were the most effective treatments in improving disability at the longest follow-up. Compared to placebo, clazosentan (10 mg/kg; OR, 0.39 [95\% CI, 0.22\textendash 0.68]; high certainty; ARR, -16.65\%), nicardipine (OR, 0.48 [95\% CI, 0.24\textendash 0.94]; moderate certainty; ARR, -13.70\%), fasudil (OR, 0.55 [95\% CI, 0.31\textendash 0.98]; moderate certainty; ARR, -11.54\%), and magnesium (OR, 0.66 [95\% CI, 0.46\textendash 0.94]; high certainty; ARR, -8.37\%) proved most effective in reducing the likelihood of delayed cerebral ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: Nimodipine and cilostazol are likely the most effective treatments in preventing morbidity and mortality in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Clazosentan, nicardipine, fasudil, and magnesium showed beneficial effects on delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm but they were not found to reduce mortality or disability. Future trials are warranted to elaborately investigate the prophylactic effects of medications that may improve mortality and long-term functional outcomes, such as cilostazol and clazosentan.},

  abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in RCTs over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more difficult than commonly believed. At best, an RCT yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justification is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding `external validity' is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its potential contribution. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not `what works', but `why things work'.},

  abstract = {In critically ill patients, fluid infusion is aimed at increasing cardiac output and tissue perfusion. However, it may contribute to fluid overload which may be harmful. Thus, volume status, risks and potential efficacy of fluid administration and/or removal should be carefully evaluated, and monitoring techniques help for this purpose. Central venous pressure is a marker of right ventricular preload. Very low values indicate hypovolemia, while extremely high values suggest fluid harmfulness. The pulmonary artery catheter enables a comprehensive assessment of the hemodynamic profile and is particularly useful for indicating the risk of pulmonary oedema through the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. Besides cardiac output and preload, transpulmonary thermodilution measures extravascular lung water, which reflects the extent of lung flooding and assesses the risk of fluid infusion. Echocardiography estimates the volume status through intravascular volumes and pressures. Finally, lung ultrasound estimates lung edema. Guided by these variables, the decision to infuse fluid should first consider specific triggers, such as signs of tissue hypoperfusion. Second, benefits and risks of fluid infusion should be weighted. Thereafter, fluid responsiveness should be assessed. Monitoring techniques help for this purpose, especially by providing real time and precise measurements of cardiac output. When decided, fluid resuscitation should be performed through fluid challenges, the effects of which should be assessed through critical endpoints including cardiac output. This comprehensive evaluation of the risk, benefits and efficacy of fluid infusion helps to individualize fluid management, which should be preferred over a fixed restrictive or liberal strategy.},

  abstract = {Background: While obesity confers an increased risk of death in the general population, numerous studies have reported an association between obesity and improved survival among critically ill patients. This contrary finding has been referred to as the obesity paradox. In this retrospective study, two causal inference approaches were used to address whether the survival of non-obese critically ill patients would have been improved if they had been obese. Methods: The study cohort comprised 6557 adult critically ill patients hospitalized at the Intensive Care Unit of the Ghent University Hospital between 2015 and 2017. Obesity was defined as a body mass index of {$\geq$} 30 kg/m2. Two causal inference approaches were used to estimate the average effect of obesity in the non-obese (AON): a traditional approach that used regression adjustment for confounding and that assumed missingness completely at random and a robust approach that used machine learning within the targeted maximum likelihood estimation framework along with multiple imputation of missing values under the assumption of missingness at random. 1754 (26.8\%) patients were discarded in the traditional approach because of at least one missing value for obesity status or confounders. Results: Obesity was present in 18.9\% of patients. The in-hospital mortality was 14.6\% in non-obese patients and 13.5\% in obese patients. The raw marginal risk difference for in-hospital mortality between obese and non-obese patients was - 1.06\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) - 3.23 to 1.11\%, P = 0.337). The traditional approach resulted in an AON of - 2.48\% (95\% CI - 4.80 to - 0.15\%, P = 0.037), whereas the robust approach yielded an AON of - 0.59\% (95\% CI - 2.77 to 1.60\%, P = 0.599). Conclusions: A causal inference approach that is robust to residual confounding bias due to model misspecification and selection bias due to missing (at random) data mitigates the obesity paradox observed in critically ill patients, whereas a traditional approach results in even more paradoxical findings. The robust approach does not provide evidence that the survival of non-obese critically ill patients would have been improved if they had been obese.},

Preoxygenation combining the use of inspiratory support and positive end-expiratory pressure should remain the standard method for preoxygenation of hypoxemic patients. Apneic oxygenation using high-flow nasal oxygen may be supplemented, to prevent further hypoxemia during tracheal intubation. Face mask ventilation after rapid sequence induction may also be used to prevent hypoxemia, in selected patients without high-risk of aspiration. Hemodynamic optimization and management are essential before, during and after the intubation procedure. All these elements can be integrated in a bundle. An airway management algorithm should be adopted in each ICU and adapted to the needs, situation and expertise of each operator. Videolaryngoscopes should be used by experienced operators.},

It should be addressed whether the study population differs from the intended source population with respect to characteristics that influence outcome. (ii) The target population will, by definition, differ from the study population with respect to geographical, temporal and ethnical conditions.

Results: Of 2,066 patients included in the analyses, associations were identified between ICH sites and poor outcomes: involvement of posterior limb of internal capsule increased risks of death or major disability (odds ratio [OR] 2.10) and disability (OR 1.81); thalamic involvement increased risks of death or major disability (OR 2.24) and death (OR 1.97). Involvement of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, thalamus, and infratentorial sites were each associated with poor EQ-5D utility score (\#0.7 [median]; OR 1.87, 2.14, and 2.81, respectively). Posterior limb of internal capsule involvement was strongly associated with low scores across all health-related quality of life domains. ICH encompassing the thalamus and posterior limb of internal capsule were associated with death or major disability, major disability, and poor EQ-5D utility score (OR 1.72, 2.26, and 1.71, respectively).

Hemostatic efficacy and reversal of anti-FXa activity with andexanet were assessed in patients from the ANNEXA-4 study (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of FXa Inhibitors) with intracranial hemorrhage (ICrH). METHODS: ANNEXA-4 was a single-arm study evaluating andexanet in patients presenting with major bleeding {$\leq$}18 hours after taking an FXa inhibitor. Patients received a bolus plus 2-hour infusion of andexanet. Brain imaging in patients with ICrH was performed at baseline and at 1 and 12 hours postandexanet infusion. Coprimary efficacy outcomes were change in anti-FXa activity and hemostatic efficacy at 12 hours (excellent/good efficacy defined as {$\leq$}35\% increase in hemorrhage volume/thickness). Safety outcomes included occurrence of thrombotic events and death at 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 227 patients with ICrH were included in the safety population (51.5\% male; mean age 79.3 years) and 171 in the efficacy population (99 spontaneous and 72 traumatic bleeds). In efficacy evaluable patients, excellent/good hemostasis 12 hours postandexanet occurred in 77 out of 98 (78.6\%) and in 58 out of 70 (82.9\%) patients with spontaneous and traumatic bleeding, respectively. In the subanalysis by FXa inhibitor treatment group in the efficacy population, median of percent change in anti-FXa from baseline to nadir showed a decrease of 93.8\% for apixaban-treated patients (n=99) and by 92.6\% for rivaroxaban-treated patients (n=59). Within 30 days, death occurred in 34 out of 227 (15.0\%) patients and thrombotic events occurred in 21 out of 227 (9.3\%) patients (safety population). CONCLUSIONS: Andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity in FXa inhibitor-treated patients with ICrH, with a high rate of hemostatic efficacy. Andexanet may substantially benefit patients with ICrH, the most serious complication of anticoagulation.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage is a devastating disease, accounting for 10 to 15\% of all types of stroke; however, it is associated with disproportionally higher rates of mortality and disability. Despite significant progress in the acute management of these patients, the ideal surgical management is still to be determined. Surgical hematoma drainage has many theoretical benefits, such as the prevention of mass effect and cerebral herniation, reduction in intracranial pressure, and the decrease of excitotoxicity and neurotoxicity of blood products., Several surgical techniques have been considered, such as open craniotomy, decompressive craniectomy, neuroendoscopy, and minimally invasive catheter evacuation followed by thrombolysis. Open craniotomy is the most studied approach in this clinical scenario, the first randomized controlled trial dating from the early 1960s. Since then, a large number of studies have been published, which included two large, well-designed, well-powered, multicenter, multinational, randomized clinical trials. These studies, The International Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (STICH), and the STICH II have shown no clinical benefit for early surgical evacuation of intraparenchymal hematoma in patients with spontaneous supratentorial hemorrhage when compared with best medical management plus delayed surgery if necessary. However, the results of STICH trials may not be generalizable, because of the high rates of patients' crossover from medical management to the surgical group. Without these high crossover percentages, the rates of unfavorable outcome and death with conservative management would have been higher. Additionally, comatose patients and patients at risk of cerebral herniation were not included. In these cases, surgery may be lifesaving, which prevented those patients of being enrolled in such trials. This article reviews the clinical evidence of surgical hematoma evacuation, and its role to decrease mortality and improve long-term functional outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Whether the antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of glucocorticoids may decrease mortality among patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia is unclear. METHODS In this phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned adults who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for severe community-acquired pneumonia to receive intravenous hydrocortisone (200 mg daily for either 4 or 8 days as determined by clinical improvement, followed by tapering for a total of 8 or 14 days) or to receive placebo. All the patients received standard therapy, including antibiotics and supportive care. The primary outcome was death at 28 days. RESULTS A total of 800 patients had undergone randomization when the trial was stopped after the second planned interim analysis. Data from 795 patients were analyzed. By day 28, death had occurred in 25 of 400 patients (6.2\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 8.6) in the hydrocortisone group and in 47 of 395 patients (11.9\%; 95\% CI, 8.7 to 15.1) in the placebo group (absolute difference, -5.6 percentage points; 95\% CI, -9.6 to -1.7; P\,=\,0.006). Among the patients who were not undergoing mechanical ventilation at baseline, endotracheal intubation was performed in 40 of 222 (18.0\%) in the hydrocortisone group and in 65 of 220 (29.5\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.40 to 0.86). Among the patients who were not receiving vasopressors at baseline, such therapy was initiated by day 28 in 55 of 359 (15.3\%) of the hydrocortisone group and in 86 of 344 (25.0\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.43 to 0.82). The frequencies of hospital-acquired infections and gastrointestinal bleeding were similar in the two groups; patients in the hydrocortisone group received higher daily doses of insulin during the first week of treatment.

However, population sorting and other confounders make it difficult to disentangle the effects of place on health from other geographic differences in life expectancy. Recent studies have overcome such challenges to demonstrate that place of residence substantially influences health and mortality. Whether policies that encourage people to move to places that are better for their health or that improve areas that are detrimental to health are desirable depends on the mechanisms behind place effects, yet these mechanisms remain poorly understood.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Myocardial infarction is a frequent cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, the benefits of early coronary angiography and revascularization in resuscitated patients without electrocardiographic evidence of ST-segment elevation are unclear. METHODS In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 554 patients with successfully resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of possible coronary origin to undergo either immediate coronary angiography (immediate-angiography group) or initial intensive care assessment with delayed or selective angiography (delayed-angiography group). All the patients had no evidence of ST-segment elevation on postresuscitation electrocardiography. The primary end point was death from any cause at 30 days. Secondary end points included a composite of death from any cause or severe neurologic deficit at 30 days. RESULTS A total of 530 of 554 patients (95.7\%) were included in the primary analysis. At 30 days, 143 of 265 patients (54.0\%) in the immediate-angiography group and 122 of 265 patients (46.0\%) in the delayed-angiography group had died (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.00 to 1.63; P\,=\,0.06). The composite of death or severe neurologic deficit occurred more frequently in the immediate-angiography group (in 164 of 255 patients [64.3\%]) than in the delayed-angiography group (in 138 of 248 patients [55.6\%]), for a relative risk of 1.16 (95\% CI, 1.00 to 1.34). Values for peak troponin release and for the incidence of moderate or severe bleeding, stroke, and renal-replacement therapy were similar in the two groups.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Perioperative bleeding is common in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic drug that may safely decrease such bleeding. METHODS We conducted a trial involving patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to receive tranexamic acid (1-g intravenous bolus) or placebo at the start and end of surgery (reported here) and, with the use of a partial factorial design, a hypotension-avoidance or hypertension-avoidance strategy (not reported here). The primary efficacy outcome was life-threatening bleeding, major bleeding, or bleeding into a critical organ (composite bleeding outcome) at 30 days. The primary safety outcome was myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, nonhemorrhagic stroke, peripheral arterial thrombosis, or symptomatic proximal venous thromboembolism (composite cardiovascular outcome) at 30 days. To establish the noninferiority of tranexamic acid to placebo for the composite cardiovascular outcome, the upper boundary of the one-sided 97.5\% confidence interval for the hazard ratio had to be below 1.125, and the one-sided P value had to be less than 0.025. RESULTS A total of 9535 patients underwent randomization. A composite bleeding outcome event occurred in 433 of 4757 patients (9.1\%) in the tranexamic acid group and in 561 of 4778 patients (11.7\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.67 to 0.87; absolute difference, -2.6 percentage points; 95\% CI, -3.8 to -1.4; two-sided P{$<$}0.001 for superiority). A composite cardiovascular outcome event occurred in 649 of 4581 patients (14.2\%) in the tranexamic acid group and in 639 of 4601 patients (13.9\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.92 to 1.14; upper boundary of the one-sided 97.5\% CI, 1.14; absolute difference, 0.3 percentage points; 95\% CI, -1.1 to 1.7; one-sided P\,=\,0.04 for noninferiority). CONCLUSIONS Among patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, the incidence of the composite bleeding outcome was significantly lower with tranexamic acid than with placebo. Although the between-group difference in the composite cardiovascular outcome was small, the noninferiority of tranexamic acid was not established.

  abstract = {Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, and is associated with a huge societal and economic burden. Interventions for the immediate treatment of ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion are dependent on recanalisation of the occluded vessel. Trials have provided evidence supporting the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy in ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. This has resulted in changes in management and organisation of stroke care worldwide. Major determinants of effectiveness of thrombectomy include: time between stroke onset and reperfusion; location of occlusion and local collateral perfusion; adequacy of reperfusion; patient age; and stroke severity. The role of anaesthetic technique on outcome remains controversial with published research showing conflicting results. As a result, choice of conscious sedation or general anaesthesia for mechanical thrombectomy is often dependent on individual operator choice or institutional preference. More recent randomised controlled trials have suggested that protocol-driven general anaesthesia is no worse than conscious sedation and may even be associated with better outcomes. These and other studies have highlighted the importance of optimal blood pressure management as a major determinant of patient outcome. Anaesthetic management should be tailored to the individual patient and circumstances. Acute ischaemic stroke is a neurological emergency; clinicians should focus on minimising door-to-groin puncture time and the provision of high-quality periprocedural care with a particular emphasis on the maintenance of an adequate blood pressure.},

It has become a readily available, non-invasive bed-side modality for the rapid diagnosis and management of patients in various settings. Point-of-care ultrasound for assessing the heart, lung, abdomen, airway and vascular systems is now well established. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound for assessing cerebral blood flow has been in use for many years. In recent years, brain ultrasonography has been shown to be a powerful tool in the rapid bed-side assessment of cerebral haemodynamics and structural pathology. Brain ultrasound has been shown to be useful in both the emergency department and neurocritical care setting for the non-invasive assessment of raised intracranial pressure, cerebral autoregulation and diagnosis of intracranial haematoma and other spaceoccupying lesions. Point-of-care ultrasound is an important alternative technique to routine imaging and invasive monitoring techniques, and results are comparable. Competence is easily attainable without formal radiology training. With technological advancement, applications for the use of brain ultrasound continue to grow. This review discusses the clinical use of point-of-care ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of brain injury.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine whether mortality rate after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is lower in patients admitted to a neurologic or neurosurgical (neuro) intensive care unit (ICU) compared to those admitted to general ICUs. Background The utility of specialty ICUs is debated. From a cost perspective, having fewer larger ICUs is preferred. Alternatively, the impact of specialty ICUs on patient outcome is unknown. Patients with ICH are admitted routinely to both general and neuro ICUs and provide an opportunity to address this question. Setting Forty-two neuro, medical, surgical, and medical-surgical ICUs. Measurements and Main Results The study was an analysis of data prospectively collected by Project Impact over 3 yrs from 42 participating ICUs (including one neuro ICU) across the country. The records of 36,986 patients were merged with records of 3,298 patients from a second neuro ICU that collected the same data over the same period. The impact of clinical (age, race, gender, Glasgow Coma Scale score, reason for admission, insurance), ICU (size, number of ICH patients, full-time intensivist, clinical service, American College for Graduate Medical Education or Critical Care Medicine fellowship), and institutional (size, location, medical school affiliation) characteristics on hospital mortality rate of ICH patients was assessed by using a forward-enter multivariate analysis. Data from 1,038 patients were included. The 13 ICUs that admitted {$>$}20 patients accounted for 83\% of the admissions with a mortality rate that ranged from 25\% to 64\%. Multivariate analysis adjusted for patient demographics, severity of ICH, and ICU and institutional characteristics indicated that not being in a neuro ICU was associated with an increase in hospital mortality rate (odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.65\textendash 7.6). Other factors associated with higher mortality rate were greater age (OR, 1.03/year; 95\% CI, 1.01\textendash 1.04), lower Glasgow Coma Scale score (OR, 0.6/point; 95\% CI, 0.58\textendash 0.65), fewer ICH patients (OR, 1.01/patient; 95\% CI, 1.00\textendash 1.01), and smaller ICU (OR, 1.1/bed; 95\% CI, 1.02\textendash 1.13). Having a full time intensivist was associated with lower mortality rate (OR, 0.388; 95\% CI, 0.22\textendash 0.67). Conclusions For patients with acute ICH, admission to a neuro vs. general ICU is associated with reduced mortality rate.}

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: In clinical trials, the relative risk or risk ratio (RR) is a mainstay of reporting of the effect magnitude for an intervention. The RR is the ratio of the probability of an outcome in an intervention group to its probability in a control group. Thus, the RR provides a measure of change in the likelihood of an event linked to a given intervention. This measure has been widely used because it is today considered a measure with ``portability'' across varying outcome prevalence, especially when the outcome is rare. It turns out, however, that there is a much more important problem with this ratio, and this paper aims to demonstrate this problem. Methods: We used mathematical derivation to determine if the RR is a measure of effect magnitude alone (i.e., a larger absolute value always indicating a stronger effect) or not. We also used the same derivation to determine its relationship to the prevalence of an outcome. We confirm the derivation results with a follow-up analysis of 140,620 trials scraped from the Cochrane. Results: We demonstrate that the RR varies for reasons other than the magnitude of the effect because it is a ratio of two posterior probabilities, both of which are dependent on baseline prevalence of an outcome. In addition, we demonstrate that the RR shifts toward its null value with increasing outcome prevalence. The shift toward the null happens regardless of the strength of the association between intervention and outcome. The odds ratio (OR), the other commonly used ratio, measures solely the effect magnitude and has no relationship to the prevalence of an outcome in a study nor does it overestimate the RR as is commonly thought. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the need to (1) end the primary use of the RR in clinical trials and meta-analyses as its direct interpretation is not meaningful, (2) replace the RR by the OR, and (3) only use the postintervention risk recalculated from the OR for any expected level of baseline risk in absolute terms for purposes of interpretation such as the number needed to treat. These results will have far-reaching implications such as reducing misleading results from clinical trials and meta-analyses and ushering in a new era in the reporting of such trials or meta-analyses in practice. \'O 2020 The Authors.

Whereas vaccine-derived immunity develops over time, neutralizing monoclonal-antibody treatment provides immediate, passive immunity and may limit disease progression and complications. METHODS In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, a cohort of ambulatory patients with mild or moderate Covid-19 who were at high risk for progression to severe disease to receive a single intravenous infusion of either a neutralizing monoclonal-antibody combination agent (2800 mg of bamlanivimab and 2800 mg of etesevimab, administered together) or placebo within 3 days after a laboratory diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The primary outcome was the overall clinical status of the patients, defined as Covid-19\textendash related hospitalization or death from any cause by day 29. RESULTS A total of 1035 patients underwent randomization and received an infusion of bamlanivimab\textendash etesevimab or placebo. The mean ({$\pm$}SD) age of the patients was 53.8{$\pm$}16.8 years, and 52.0\% were adolescent girls or women. By day 29, a total of 11 of 518 patients (2.1\%) in the bamlanivimab\textendash etesevimab group had a Covid-19\textendash related hospitalization or death from any cause, as compared with 36 of 517 patients (7.0\%) in the placebo group (absolute risk difference, -4.8 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -7.4 to -2.3; relative risk difference, 70\%; P{$<$}0.001). No deaths occurred in the bamlanivimab\textendash etesevimab group; in the placebo group, 10 deaths occurred, 9 of which were designated by the trial investigators as Covid-19\textendash related. At day 7, a greater reduction from baseline in the log viral load was observed among patients who received bamlanivimab plus etesevimab than among those who received placebo (difference from placebo in the change from baseline, -1.20; 95\% CI, -1.46 to -0.94; P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS Among high-risk ambulatory patients, bamlanivimab plus etesevimab led to a lower incidence of Covid-19\textendash related hospitalization and death than did placebo and accelerated the decline in the SARS-CoV-2 viral load.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Traditionally, the dominant (usually left) cerebral hemisphere is regarded as the more important one, and everyday clinical decisions are influenced by this view. However, reported results on the impact of lesion laterality are inconsistent in the scarce literature on quality of life (QOL) in patients with brain tumors. The authors aimed to study which cerebral hemisphere is the most important to patients with intracranial tumors with respect to health-related QOL (HRQOL). METHODS Two hundred forty-eight patients with unilateral, unifocal gliomas or meningiomas scheduled for primary surgery were included in this prospective cohort study. Generic HRQOL was measured using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire preoperatively and after 4\textendash 6 weeks. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of data were performed. RESULTS Tumor volumes were significantly larger in right-sided tumors at diagnosis, and language or speech problems were more common in left-sided lesions. Otherwise, no differences existed in baseline data. The median EQ-5D-3L index was 0.73 (range -0.24 to 1.00) in patients with right-sided tumors and 0.76 (range -0.48 to 1.00) in patients with left-sided tumors (p = 0.709). Due to the difference in tumor volumes at baseline, histopathology and tumor volumes were matched in 198 patients. EQ-5D-3L index scores in this 1:1 matched analysis were 0.74 (range -0.7 to 1.00) for patients with right-sided and 0.76 (range -0.48 to 1.00) for left-sided lesions (p = 0.342). In the analysis of longitudinal data, no association was found between tumor laterality and postoperative EQ-5D-3L index scores (p = 0.957) or clinically significant change in HRQOL following surgery (p = 0.793). CONCLUSIONS In an overall patient-reported QOL perspective, tumor laterality does not appear to be of significant importance for generic HRQOL in patients with intracranial tumors. This may imply that right-sided cerebral functions are underestimated by clinicians.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In mechanically ventilated patients, deep sedation is often assumed to induce ``respirolysis,'' that is, lyse spontaneous respiratory effort, whereas light sedation is often assumed to preserve spontaneous effort. This study was conducted to determine validity of these common assumptions, evaluating the association of respiratory drive with sedation depth and ventilator-free days in acute respiratory failure. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Patients were enrolled during 2 month-long periods in 2016\textendash 2017 from five ICUs representing medical, surgical, and cardiac specialties at a U.S. academic hospital. PATIENTS: Eligible patients were critically ill adults receiving invasive ventilation initiated no more than 36 hours before enrollment. Patients with neuromuscular disease compromising respiratory function or expiratory flow limitation were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Respiratory drive was measured via P0.1, the change in airway pressure during a 0.1-second airway occlusion at initiation of patient inspiratory effort, every 12 {$\pm$} 3 hours for 3 days. Sedation depth was evaluated via the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Analyses evaluated the association of P0.1 with Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (primary outcome) and ventilator-free days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-six patients undergoing 197 bedside evaluations across five ICUs were included. P0.1 ranged between 0 and 13.3\,cm H2O (median [interquartile range], 0.1\,cm H2O [0.0\textendash 1.3\,cm H2O]). P0.1 was not significantly correlated with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (R , Spearman 0.02; 95\% CI, \textendash 0.12 to 0.16; p = 0.80). Considering P0.1 terciles (range less than 0.2, 0.2\textendash 1.0, and greater than 1.0\,cm H2O), patients in the middle tercile had significantly more ventilator-free days than the lowest tercile (incidence rate ratio, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.65\textendash 0.93; p {$<$} 0.01) or highest tercile (incidence rate ratio, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.48\textendash 0.70; p {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Sedation depth is not a reliable marker of respiratory drive during critical illness. Respiratory drive can be low, moderate, or high across the range of routinely targeted sedation depth.},

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between functional outcome, measured by mRS, and cognition, measured by mini-mental state examination (MMSE), after aSAH. A secondary analysis evaluated the impact of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) on the proportion of patients who had cognitive impairment. Methods We performed a post hoc analysis of the Clazosentan to Overcome Neurological Ischemia and Infarction Occurring After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (CONSCIOUS-1) trial data. MMSE and mRS scores were compared using Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test with pairwise comparison post hoc analysis. Cognitive impairment was defined as MMSE score {$<$}27. A stepwise logistic regression model evaluated whether DCI was a predictor of cognitive impairment. Results CONSCIOUS-1 comprised 413 patients. Of these, 337 took an MMSE at their 12-week follow-up. Mean MMSE score was 27 with a median of 29 (range, 0\textendash 30; SD 5.4). There were no significant differences between MMSE scores of patients who had 12-week mRS scores of 0\textendash 2. On multivariate analysis, DCI was independently associated with cognitive impairment after aSAH. Conclusions Patients considered to have a good outcome on mRS had varying degrees of cognitive function on MMSE, whereas development of DCI was an independent predictor of cognitive impairment after aSAH. MMSE may not be sensitive enough to discern subtle defects in cognition, as the median score was 29 out of~30.},

  abstract = {Chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH) is an encapsulated collection of blood and fluid on the surface of the brain. Historically considered a result of head trauma, recent evidence suggests there are more complex processes involved. Trauma may be absent or very minor and does not explain the progressive, chronic course of the condition. This review focuses on several key processes involved in CSDH development: angiogenesis, fibrinolysis and inflammation. The characteristic membrane surrounding the CSDH has been identified as a source of fluid exudation and haemorrhage. Angiogenic stimuli lead to the creation of fragile blood vessels within membrane walls, whilst fibrinolytic processes prevent clot formation resulting in continued haemorrhage. An abundance of inflammatory cells and markers have been identified within the membranes and subdural fluid and are likely to contribute to propagating an inflammatory response which stimulates ongoing membrane growth and fluid accumulation. Currently, the mainstay of treatment for CSDH is surgical drainage, which has associated risks of recurrence requiring repeat surgery. Understanding of the underlying pathophysiological processes has been applied to developing potential drug treatments. Ongoing research is needed to identify if these therapies are successful in controlling the inflammatory and angiogenic disease processes leading to control and resolution of CSDH.},

Advanced neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques have revealed new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying recovery of consciousness and have enabled the identification of preserved brain networks in patients who seem unresponsive, thus raising hope for more accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Emerging evidence suggests that covert consciousness, or cognitive motor dissociation (CMD), is present in up to 15\textendash 20\% of patients with DoC and that detection of CMD in the intensive care unit can predict functional recovery at 1\,year post injury. Although fundamental questions remain about which patients with DoC have the potential for recovery, novel pharmacological and electrophysiological therapies have shown the potential to reactivate injured neural networks and promote re-emergence of consciousness. In this Review, we focus on mechanisms of recovery from DoC in the acute and subacute-to-chronic stages, and we discuss recent progress in detecting and predicting recovery of consciousness. We also describe the developments in pharmacological and electrophysiological therapies that are creating new opportunities to improve the lives of patients with DoC.},

  abstract = {Background/Objective:\hspace{0.6em} For patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) and their families, the search for new therapies has been a source of hope and frustration. Almost all clinical trials in patients with DoC have been limited by small sample sizes, lack of placebo groups, and use of heterogeneous outcome measures. As a result, few therapies have strong evidence to support their use; amantadine is the only therapy recommended by current clinical guidelines, specifically for patients with DoC caused by severe traumatic brain injury. To foster and advance development of consciousness-promoting therapies for patients with DoC, the Curing Coma Campaign convened a Coma Science Work Group to perform a gap analysis. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We consider five classes of therapies: (1) pharmacologic; (2) electromagnetic; (3) mechanical; (4) sensory; and (5) regenerative. For each class of therapy, we summarize the state of the science, identify gaps in knowledge, and suggest future directions for therapy development. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Knowledge gaps in all five therapeutic classes can be attributed to the lack of: (1) a unifying conceptual framework for evaluating therapeutic mechanisms of action; (2) large-scale randomized controlled trials; and (3) pharmacodynamic biomarkers that measure subclinical therapeutic effects in early-phase trials. To address these gaps, we propose a precision medicine approach in which clinical trials selectively enroll patients based upon their physiological receptivity to targeted therapies, and therapeutic effects are measured by complementary behavioral, neuroimaging, and electrophysiologic endpoints. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} This personalized approach can be realized through rigorous clinical trial design and international collaboration, both of which will be essential for advancing the development of new therapies and ultimately improving the lives of patients with DoC.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of fluid bolus administration on the incidence of severe hypotension, cardiac arrest, and death. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial enrolled 1067 critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation with sedation and positive pressure ventilation at 11 intensive care units in the US between February 1, 2019, and May 24, 2021. The date of final follow-up was June 21, 2021. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a 500-mL intravenous fluid bolus (n = 538) or no fluid bolus (n = 527). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was cardiovascular collapse (defined as new or increased receipt of vasopressors or a systolic blood pressure {$<$}65 mm Hg between induction of anesthesia and 2 minutes after tracheal intubation, or cardiac arrest or death between induction of anesthesia and 1 hour after tracheal intubation). The secondary outcome was the incidence of death prior to day 28, which was censored at hospital discharge. RESULTS Among 1067 patients randomized, 1065 (99.8\%) completed the trial and were included in the primary analysis (median age, 62 years [IQR, 51-70 years]; 42.1\% were women). Cardiovascular collapse occurred in 113 patients (21.0\%) in the fluid bolus group and in 96 patients (18.2\%) in the no fluid bolus group (absolute difference, 2.8\% [95\% CI, -2.2\% to 7.7\%]; P = .25). New or increased receipt of vasopressors occurred in 20.6\% of patients in the fluid bolus group compared with 17.6\% of patients in the no fluid bolus group, a systolic blood pressure of less than 65 mm Hg occurred in 3.9\% vs 4.2\%, respectively, cardiac arrest occurred in 1.7\% vs 1.5\%, and death occurred in 0.7\% vs 0.6\%. Death prior to day 28 (censored at hospital discharge) occurred in 218 patients (40.5\%) in the fluid bolus group compared with 223 patients (42.3\%) in the no fluid bolus group (absolute difference, -1.8\% [95\% CI, -7.9\% to 4.3\%]; P = .55). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation, administration of an intravenous fluid bolus compared with no fluid bolus did not significantly decrease the incidence of cardiovascular collapse.},

Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of data from a prospective cohort study from 1994 through 2007 comprising 2929 individuals 65 years old and older without dementia at baseline residing in the community in the Seattle area and belonging to the Group Health Cooperative. Participants with 2 or more study visits were included, and those who had a hospitalization for a diagnosis of primary brain injury were censored at the time of hospitalization. Individuals were screened with the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) (score range, 0-100) every 2 years at follow-up visits, and those with a score less than 86 underwent a clinical examination for dementia. Main Outcome Measures Score on the CASI at follow-up study visits and incident dementia diagnosed in study participants, adjusted for baseline cognitive scores, age, and other risk factors. Results During a mean (SD) follow-up of 6.1 (3.2) years, 1601 participants had no hospitalization, 1287 had 1 or more noncritical illness hospitalizations, and 41 had 1 or more critical illness hospitalizations. The CASI score was assessed more than 45 days after discharge for 94.3\% of participants. Adjusted CASI scores averaged 1.01 points lower for visits following acute care illness hospitalization compared with follow-up visits not following any hospitalization (95\% confidence interval [CI], -1.33 to -0.70; PϽ.001) and 2.14 points lower on average for visits following critical illness hospitalization (95\% CI, -4.24 to -0.03; P=.047). There were 146 cases of dementia among those not hospitalized, 228 cases of dementia among those with 1 or more noncritical illness hospitalizations, and 5 cases of dementia among those with 1 or more critical illness hospitalizations. The adjusted hazard ratio for incident dementia was 1.4 following a noncritical illness hospitalization (95\% CI, 1.1 to 1.7; P=.001) and 2.3 following a critical illness hospitalization (95\% CI, 0.9 to 5.7; P=.09). Conclusions Among a cohort of older adults without dementia at baseline, those who experienced acute care hospitalization and critical illness hospitalization had a greater likelihood of cognitive decline compared with those who had no hospitalization. Noncritical illness hospitalization was significantly associated with the development of dementia.},

  abstract = {Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate analysis that reduces the complexity of datasets while preserving data covariance. The outcome can be visualized on colorful scatterplots, ideally with only a minimal loss of information. PCA applications, implemented in well-cited packages like EIGENSOFT and PLINK, are extensively used as the foremost analyses in population genetics and related fields (e.g., animal and plant or medical genetics). PCA outcomes are used to shape study design, identify, and characterize individuals and populations, and draw historical and ethnobiological conclusions on origins, evolution, dispersion, and relatedness. The replicability crisis in science has prompted us to evaluate whether PCA results are reliable, robust, and replicable. We analyzed twelve common test cases using an intuitive color-based model alongside human population data. We demonstrate that PCA results can be artifacts of the data and can be easily manipulated to generate desired outcomes. PCA adjustment also yielded unfavorable outcomes in association studies. PCA results may not be reliable, robust, or replicable as the field assumes. Our findings raise concerns about the validity of results reported in the population genetics literature and related fields that place a disproportionate reliance upon PCA outcomes and the insights derived from them. We conclude that PCA may have a biasing role in genetic investigations and that 32,000-216,000 genetic studies should be reevaluated. An alternative mixed-admixture population genetic model is discussed.},

We found that stratification performed poorly with few outcome events, and inverse probability weighting gave imprecise estimates of treatment effect and undue influence to a small number of observations when substantial confounding was present. Covariate adjustment and matching performed well in all of our examples, although matching tended to give less precise estimates in some cases. PS methods are not necessarily superior to conventional covariate adjustment, and care should be taken to select the most suitable method.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used observational data on 17 372 patients with cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database (2007-2009) with complete follow-up until 2011. The SEER-Medicare database links 17 US cancer registries and claims files from Medicare and Medicaid in 12 US states. We included individuals with a new diagnosis of colorectal, breast, prostate, or bladder cancer who had not been prescribed statins for at least 6 months before the cancer diagnosis. Individuals were duplicated, and each replicate was assigned to either the strategy ``statin therapy initiation within 6 months after diagnosis'' or ``no statin therapy initiation.'' Replicates were censored when they stopped following their assigned strategy, and the potential selection bias was adjusted for via inverse-probability weighting. Hazard ratios (HRs), cumulative incidences, and risk differences were calculated for all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality. We then compared our estimates with those obtained using the same analytic approaches used in previous observational studies. EXPOSURES Statin therapy initiation within 6 months after cancer diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cancer-specific and all-cause mortality using SEER-Medicare data and data from previous studies. Supplemental content RESULTS Of the 17 372 patients whose data were analyzed, 8440 (49\%) were men, and 8932 (51\%) were women (mean [SD] age, 76.4 [7.4] years; range, 66-115 years). The adjusted HR (95\% CI) comparing statin therapy initiation vs no initiation was 1.00 (0.88-1.15) for cancer-specific mortality and 1.07 (0.93-1.21) for overall mortality. Cumulative incidence curves for both groups were almost overlapping (the risk difference never exceeded 0.8\%). In contrast, the methods used by prior studies resulted in an inverse association between statin use and mortality (pooled hazard ratio 0.69). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE After using methods that are not susceptible to selection bias from prevalent users and to immortal time bias, we found that initiation of therapy with statins within 6 months after cancer diagnosis did not appear to improve 3-year cancer-specific or overall survival.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE\hspace{0.6em} Clazosentan has been investigated globally for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The authors evaluated its effects on vasospasm-related morbidity and all-cause mortality following aSAH in Japanese patients. METHODS\hspace{0.6em} Two similar double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies were conducted in 57 Japanese centers in patients with aSAH, after aneurysms were secured by endovascular coiling in one study and surgical clipping in the other. In each study, patients were randomly administered intravenous clazosentan (10 mg/hr) or placebo (1:1) starting within 48 hours of aSAH and for up to 15 days after aSAH. Stratified randomization based on World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade was performed using a centralized interactive web response system. Vasospasm-related morbidity and all-cause mortality within 6 weeks post-aSAH, including new cerebral infarcts and delayed ischemic neurological deficits as well as all-cause mortality, were the first primary endpoint in each study. The second primary endpoint was all-cause morbidity (new cerebral infarct or delayed ischemic neurological deficit from any causes) and all-cause mortality (all-cause morbidity/mortality) within 6 weeks post-aSAH. The incidence of individual components of the primary morbidity/mortality endpoints within 6 weeks and patient outcome at 12 weeks post-aSAH (including the modified Rankin Scale scores) were also evaluated. The above analyses were also performed in the population pooled from both studies. RESULTS\hspace{0.6em} In each study, 221 patients were randomized and 220 were included in the full analysis set of the primary analysis (109 in each clazosentan group, 111 in each placebo group). Clazosentan significantly reduced the incidence of vasospasm-related morbidity and all-cause mortality after aneurysm coiling (from 28.8\% to 13.6\%; relative risk reduction 53\%; 95\% CI 17\%\textendash 73\%) and after clipping (from 39.6\% to 16.2\%; relative risk reduction 59\%; 95\% CI 33\%\textendash 75\%). All-cause morbidity/mortality and poor outcome (dichotomized modified Rankin Scale scores) were significantly reduced by clazosentan after preplanned study pooling. Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar to those reported previously. CONCLUSIONS\hspace{0.6em} Clazosentan significantly reduced the combined incidence of vasospasm-related morbidity and allcause mortality post-aSAH with no unexpected safety findings.

Design and Setting A prospective, observational study of European ICUs. Participants Consecutive patients who died or had any limitation of therapy. Intervention Prospectively defined end-of-life practices in 37 ICUs in 17 European countries were studied from January 1, 1999, to June 30, 2000. Main Outcome Measures Comparison and analysis of the frequencies and patterns of end-of-life care by geographic regions and different patients and professionals. Results Of 31417 patients admitted to ICUs, 4248 patients (13.5\%) died or had a limitation of life-sustaining therapy. Of these, 3086 patients (72.6\%) had limitations of treatments (10\% of admissions). Substantial intercountry variability was found in the limitations and the manner of dying: unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 20\% (range, 5\%-48\%), brain death in 8\% (range, 0\%-15\%), withholding therapy in 38\% (range, 16\%-70\%), withdrawing therapy in 33\% (range, 5\%-69\%), and active shortening of the dying process in 2\% (range, 0\%-19\%). Shortening of the dying process was reported in 7 countries. Doses of opioids and benzodiazepines reported for shortening of the dying process were in the same range as those used for symptom relief in previous studies. Limitation of therapy vs continuation of life-sustaining therapy was associated with patient age, acute and chronic diagnoses, number of days in ICU, region, and religion (PϽ.001). Conclusion The limiting of life-sustaining treatment in European ICUs is common and variable. Limitations were associated with patient age, diagnoses, ICU stay, and geographic and religious factors. Although shortening of the dying process is rare, clarity between withdrawing therapies and shortening of the dying process and between therapies intended to relieve pain and suffering and those intended to shorten the dying process may be lacking.},

This review discusses current diagnostic, therapeutic, and process models that can expedite stroke treatment to achieve best outcomes. Use of stent retrievers after selection via advanced imaging is safe and effective, and is an important option for AIS patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO). Significant time delays occur before and during patient transfers, and upon comprehensive stroke center (CSC) arrival, and have deleterious effects on functional outcome. Removing obstacles, enhancing inter-facility communication, and creating acute stroke management processes and protocols are paramount strategies to enhance network efficiency. Inter-departmental CSC collaboration can significantly reduce door-to-treatment times. Streamlined stroke systems of care may result in higher treatment rates and better functional outcomes for AIS patients, simultaneously conserving healthcare dollars. Stroke systems of care should be structured regionally to minimize time to treatment. A proactive approach must be employed; a management plan incorporating stroke team prenotification and parallel processes between departments can save valuable time, maximize brain salvage, and reduce disability from stroke.}

RESULTS: Clustering grouped 2908 unique patient encounters into 4 unique biomarker phenotypes based on levels of c-reactive protein, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, and partial thromboplastin time. The most severe cluster phenotype had the highest prevalence of AIS (3.6\%, P{$<$}0.001), in-hospital AIS (53\%, P{$<$}0.002), severe AIS (31\%, P=0.004), and cryptogenic AIS (73\%, P{$<$}0.001). D-dimer was the only biomarker independently associated with prevalent AIS with quartile 4 having an 8-fold higher risk of AIS compared to quartile 1 (P=0.005), a finding that was further corroborated in a separate cohort of 157 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and AIS. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19\textendash associated ischemic stroke may be related to COVID-19 illness severity and associated coagulopathy as defined by increasing D-dimer burden.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Sickle cell disease is characterized by hemolytic anemia, pain, and progressive organ damage. A high level of erythrocyte fetal hemoglobin (HbF) comprising {$\alpha$}- and {$\gamma$}-globins may ameliorate these manifestations by mitigating sickle hemoglobin polymerization and erythrocyte sickling. BCL11A is a repressor of {$\gamma$}-globin expression and HbF production in adult erythrocytes. Its down-regulation is a promising therapeutic strategy for induction of HbF. METHODS We enrolled patients with sickle cell disease in a single-center, open-label pilot study. The investigational therapy involved infusion of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with the BCH-BB694 lentiviral vector, which encodes a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting BCL11A mRNA embedded in a microRNA (shmiR), allowing erythroid lineage\textendash specific knockdown. Patients were assessed for primary end points of engraftment and safety and for hematologic and clinical responses to treatment. RESULTS As of October 2020, six patients had been followed for at least 6 months after receiving BCH-BB694 gene therapy; median follow-up was 18 months (range, 7 to 29). All patients had engraftment, and adverse events were consistent with effects of the preparative chemotherapy. All the patients who could be fully evaluated achieved robust and stable HbF induction (percentage HbF/(F+S) at most recent follow-up, 20.4 to 41.3\%), with HbF broadly distributed in red cells (F-cells 58.9 to 93.6\% of untransfused red cells) and HbF per F-cell of 9.0 to 18.6 pg per cell. Clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease were reduced or absent during the follow-up period.

  abstract = {Peri-operative neurocognitive disorders are the most common complication experienced by older individuals undergoing anaesthesia and surgery. Peri-operative neurocognitive disorders, particularly postoperative delirium, result in long-term poor outcomes including: death; dementia; loss of independence; and poor cognitive and functional outcomes. Recent changes to the nomenclature of these disorders aims to align perioperative neurocognitive disorders with cognitive disorders in the community, with consistent definitions and clinical diagnosis. Possible mechanisms include: undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease; inflammation and resulting neuroinflammation; neuronal damage; and comorbid systemic disease. Pre-operative frailty represents a significant risk for poor postoperative outcomes; it is associated with an increase in the incidence of cognitive decline at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. In addition to cognitive decline, frailty is associated with poor functional outcomes following elective non-cardiac surgery. It was recently shown that 29\% of frail patients died or experienced institutionalisation or new disability within 90 days of major elective surgery. Identification of vulnerable patients before undergoing surgery and anaesthesia is the key to preventing peri-operative neurocognitive disorders. Current approaches include: pre-operative delirium and cognitive screening; blood biomarker analysis; intra-operative management that may reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium such as lighter anaesthesia using processed electroencephalography devices; and introduction of guidelines which may reduce or prevent delirium and postoperative neurocognitive disorders. This review will address these issues and advocate for an approach to care for older peri-operative patients which starts in the community and continues throughout the pre-operative, intra-operative, postoperative and post-discharge phases of care management, involving multidisciplinary medical teams, as well as family and caregivers wherever possible.},

  abstract = {Intravascular fluid therapy is a common critical care intervention. However, the optimal type of resuscitation fluid, crystalloid or colloid, remains controversial. Despite the many theoretical benefits of human albumin administration in critically ill patients, there has been little evidence to support its widespread clinical use. Previous systematic reviews have led to conflicting results regarding the safety and efficacy of albumin. The recently reported Saline versus Albumin Evaluation study has provided conclusive evidence that 4\% albumin is as safe as saline for resuscitation, although no overall benefit of albumin use was seen. Subgroup analysis of the albumin-treated group revealed a trend towards decreased mortality in patients with septic shock, and a trend towards increased mortality in trauma patients, especially those with traumatic brain injury. The results of these subgroups, as well as the use of higher albumin concentrations and other synthetic colloids (dextrans, starches), require rigorous evaluation in clinical trials. Finally, the Saline versus Albumin Evaluation trial represents a methodological milestone in critical care medicine, due to its size, its efficient trial design, and its logistical coordination. Future studies are still required, however, to establish a therapeutic niche for albumin and other colloids.},

However, over the past 4 decades, results from well-done RCTs have repeatedly contradicted practices supported by common sense and clinical observation. Common sense and clinical observation fail for several reasons: incomplete understanding of pathophysiology, biases and unmeasured confounding in observational research, and failure to understand risks and benefits of treatments within complex systems. Concerns about traditional RCT models are legitimate, but randomization remains a critical tool to understand the causal relationship between treatments and outcomes. Instead, development and promulgation of tools to apply randomization to real-world data are needed to build the best evidence base in cardiovascular medicine.

  abstract = {Background Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is the standard-of-care treatment for stroke patients with emergent large vessel occlusions. Despite this, little is known about physician decision making regarding MT and prognostic accuracy. Methods A prospective multicenter cohort study of patients undergoing MT was performed at 11 comprehensive stroke centers. The attending neurointerventionalist completed a preprocedure survey prior to arterial access and identified key decision factors and the most likely radiographic and clinical outcome at 90 days. Post hoc review was subsequently performed to document hospital course and outcome. Results 299 patients were enrolled. Good clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0\textendash 2) was obtained in 38\% of patients. The most frequently identified factors influencing the decision to proceed with thrombectomy were site of occlusion (81\%), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (74\%), and perfusion imaging mismatch (43\%). Premorbid mRS score determination in the hyperacute setting accurately matched retrospectively collected data from the hospital admission in only 140 patients (46.8\%). Physicians correctly predicted the patient's 90 day mRS tertile (0\textendash 2, 3\textendash 4, or 5\textendash 6) and final modified Thrombolysis in Ischemic Cerebral Infarction score preprocedure in only 44.2\% and 44.3\% of patients, respectively. Clinicians tended to overestimate the influence of occlusion site and perfusion imaging on outcomes, while underestimating the importance of pre-morbid mRS. Conclusions This is the first prospective study to evaluate neurointerventionalists' ability to accurately predict clinical outcome after MT. Overall, neurointerventionalists performed poorly in prognosticating patient 90 day outcomes, raising ethical questions regarding whether MT should be withheld in patients with emergent large vessel occlusions thought to have a poor prognosis.},

  author = {Farrar, Benjamin},
  pages = {71},
  abstract = {Animal cognition research aims to understand animal minds by using a diverse range of methods across an equally diverse range of species. Throughout its history, the field has sought to mitigate various biases that occur when studying animal minds, from experimenter effects to anthropomorphism. Recently, there has also been a focus on how common scientific practices might affect the reliability and validity of published research. Usually, these issues are discussed in the literature by a small group of scholars with a specific interest in the topics. This study aimed to survey a wider range of animal cognition researchers to ask about their attitudes towards classic and contemporary issues facing the field. Two-hundred and ten active animal cognition researchers completed our survey, and provided answers on questions relating to bias, replicability, statistics, publication, and belief in animal cognition. Collectively, researchers were wary of bias in the research field as a whole, but less so in their own work. Despite sometimes (39.7\% of responses) or often (38.8\% of responses) hoping for one result over another, researchers reported that they could often (45.8\% of responses) or always (38.4\% of responses) detach from any biases to perform objectively fair tests of animal cognition. Over 70\% of researchers endorsed Morgan's canon as a useful principle but many caveated this in their free-text responses, and researchers selfreported that a median of 80\% of their studies had been published. Their free-text responses suggested a stronger publication bias against negative and inconclusive results, and results that questioned ``preferred'' theories. Researchers rarely reported having performed questionable research practices themselves \textemdash{} however they thought that other researchers sometimes (52.7\% of responses) or often (27.9\% of responses) perform them. Researchers near unanimously agreed that replication studies are important but too infrequently performed in animal cognition research, and 44.7\% of researchers agreed that their own area (44.7\% of responses), or other areas (73.0\% of responses) of research could experience a `replication crisis' if replication studies were performed. Consistently, participants' free-text responses provided a nuanced picture of the challenges animal cognition research faces, and highlighted many possible improvements. Overall, these data provide a picture of active researchers' beliefs about the animal cognition research processes that can be used to inform debates on where and how the field can improve.},

Recent findings~         Maintaining euvolemia with crystalloids seems to be the recommended fluid resuscitation for neurocritical care patients. Buffered crystalloids have been shown to reduce hyperchloremia in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage without causing hyponatremia or hypo-osmolality. In addition, in patients with traumatic brain injury, buffered solutions reduce the incidence of hyperchloremic acidosis but are not associated with intracranial pressure (ICP) alteration. Both mannitol and hypertonic saline are established as effective hyperosmolar agents to control ICP. Both agents have been shown to control ICP, but their effects on neurologic outcomes are unclear. A recent surge in preference for using hypertonic saline as a hyperosmolar agent is based on few studies without strong evidence.         Summary~         Fluid resuscitation with crystalloids seems to be reasonable in this setting although no recommendations can be made regarding type of crystalloids. Based on current evidence, elevated ICP can be effectively reduced by either hypertonic saline or mannitol.},

Secondary outcomes included complications, discharge disposition, hospital length of stay, and direct inpatient costs. The study population included 104 patients (41 admitted to the ICU and 63 admitted to the SU). After controlling for differences in baseline characteristics, there were no differences in poor functional outcome at discharge (93\% vs 85\%, P = .26) or in mean mRS (2.9 vs 3.0, P = .73). Similarly, there were no differences in the rates of complications (6\% vs 10\%, P = .44), discharged dead or to a skilled nursing facility (8\% vs 13\%, P = .59), or direct patient costs (US\$7100 vs US\$6200, P = .33). Median length of stay was significantly longer in the ICU group (5 vs 4 days, P = .01).

  abstract = {Background: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are popular tools for identifying appropriate adjustment strategies for epidemiological analysis. However, a lack of direction on how to build them is problematic. As a solution, we propose using a combination of evidence synthesis strategies and causal inference principles to integrate the DAG-building exercise within the review stages of research projects. We demonstrate this idea by introducing a novel protocol: `Evidence Synthesis for Constructing Directed Acyclic Graphs' (ESC-DAGs)'. Methods: ESC-DAGs operates on empirical studies identified by a literature search, ideally a novel systematic review or review of systematic reviews. It involves three key stages: (i) the conclusions of each study are `mapped' into a DAG; (ii) the causal structures in these DAGs are systematically assessed using several causal inference principles and are corrected accordingly; (iii) the resulting DAGs are then synthesised into one or more `integrated DAGs'. This demonstration article didactically applies ESC-DAGs to the literature on parental influences on offspring alcohol use during adolescence. Conclusions: ESC-DAGs is a practical, systematic and transparent approach for developing DAGs from background knowledge. These DAGs can then direct primary data analysis and DAG-based sensitivity analysis. ESC-DAGs has a modular design to allow researchers who are experienced DAG users to both use and improve upon the approach. It is also accessible to researchers with limited experience of DAGs or evidence synthesis.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 10\% to 20\% of stroke but carries the highest rates of mortality and morbidity of all stroke subtypes. Current treatment, however, is varied and haphazard. The most recent Cochrane systematic review refers to 4 prospective, randomized controlled trials. We present a further meta-analysis to include 3 new trials. In addition, we review the trials of Chen et al and McKissock et al and discuss aspects of their quality that, we believe, prevent their inclusion in modern day meta-analysis. Methods\textemdash Literature databases and articles were searched from 1966 to October 1999. Using the end points of death and dependency, the results of the 7 identified randomized trials were expressed as odds ratios. All available data were then analyzed with meta-analysis techniques. Analysis of relevant subsets of trials was also carried out. Results\textemdash Meta-analysis of all 7 trials shows a trend toward a higher chance of death and dependency after surgery (OR 1.20; 95\% CI 0.83 to 1.74). Meta-analysis was also carried out after exclusion of the Chen and McKissock trials for reasons discussed in the text. This meta-analysis suggests a benefit from surgery, with a reduction in the chances of death and dependency after surgical treatment by a factor of 0.63 (OR 0.63; 95\% CI 0.35 to 1.14). Conclusions\textemdash When meta-analysis is restricted to modern-day, post-CT, well-constructed, balanced trials, a trend for surgery to reduce the chances of death and dependency is found. Perhaps, then, in the modern era of CT, good neuroanesthesia, intensive care, and the operating microscope, surgery has a role in the treatment of supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage. The results of a large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial are urgently needed, and the ongoing International Surgical Trial of Intracerebral Hemorrhage should fulfill this objective.},

Setting:~         Two ICUs within a single hospital system.         Patients:~         Eight-thousand four-hundred forty-seven patients admitted to ICU from 2011 to 2014, of whom 332 had a diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. Control patients were defined as randomly selected age, sex, and comorbidity index\textendash matched nonintracranial hemorrhage ICU patients (1:4 matching ratio).         Interventions:~         None.         Measurements and Main Results:~         Mean age of ICU intracranial hemorrhage patients was 60.1 years, and 120 (36.1\%) died prior to discharge. Intracranial hemorrhage was associated with a mean total cost of \$75,869, compared with \$52,471 in control patients (p {$<$} 0.01). Mean cost per survivor of intracranial hemorrhage patients was \$118,813. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was associated with significantly higher mean total costs than intracerebral hemorrhage (\$92,794 vs \$53,491; p {$<$} 0.01) and higher mean cost per day (\$4,377 vs \$3,604; p {$<$} 0.01). Patients with intracranial hemorrhage who survived to hospital discharge were significantly costlier than decedents (\$100,979 vs \$30,872; p {$<$} 0.01). Intracranial hemorrhage associated with oral anticoagulant use had a mean total cost of \$152,373, compared with \$66,548 in nonoral anticoagulant intracranial hemorrhage (p {$<$} 0.01).         Conclusions:~         Patients admitted to ICU with intracranial hemorrhage have high costs and high mortality, leading to elevated cost per survivor. Subarachnoid hemorrhage patients incur greater costs than intracerebral hemorrhage patients, and oral anticoagulant\textendash associated intracerebral hemorrhage is particularly costly.

SER-109 is an investigational microbiome therapeutic composed of purified Firmicutes spores for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection. METHODS We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which patients who had had three or more episodes of C. difficile infection (inclusive of the qualifying acute episode) received SER-109 or placebo (four capsules daily for 3 days) after standard-of-care antibiotic treatment. The primary efficacy objective was to show superiority of SER-109 as compared with placebo in reducing the risk of C. difficile infection recurrence up to 8 weeks after treatment. Diagnosis by toxin testing was performed at trial entry, and randomization was stratified according to age and antibiotic agent received. Analyses of safety, microbiome engraftment, and metabolites were also performed. RESULTS Among the 281 patients screened, 182 were enrolled. The percentage of patients with recurrence of C. difficile infection was 12\% in the SER-109 group and 40\% in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.32; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.58; P{$<$}0.001 for a relative risk of {$<$}1.0; P{$<$}0.001 for a relative risk of {$<$}0.833). SER-109 led to less frequent recurrence than placebo in analyses stratified according to age stratum (relative risk, 0.24 [95\% CI, 0.07 to 0.78] for patients {$<$}65 years of age and 0.36 [95\% CI, 0.18 to 0.72] for those {$\geq$}65 years) and antibiotic received (relative risk, 0.41 [95\% CI, 0.22 to 0.79] with vancomycin and 0.09 [95\% CI, 0.01 to 0.63] with fidaxomicin). Most adverse events were mild to moderate and were gastrointestinal in nature, with similar numbers in the two groups. SER-109 dose species were detected as early as week 1 and were associated with bile-acid profiles that are known to inhibit C. difficile spore germination. CONCLUSIONS In patients with symptom resolution of C. difficile infection after treatment with standard-of-care antibiotics, oral administration of SER-109 was superior to placebo in reducing the risk of recurrent infection. The observed safety profile of SER-109 was similar to that of placebo. (Funded by Seres Therapeutics; ECOSPOR III ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03183128.)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Whether the use of balanced multielectrolyte solution (BMES) in preference to 0.9\% sodium chloride solution (saline) in critically ill patients reduces the risk of acute kidney injury or death is uncertain. METHODS In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned critically ill patients to receive BMES (Plasma-Lyte 148) or saline as fluid therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 90 days. The primary outcome was death from any cause within 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes were receipt of new renal-replacement therapy and the maximum increase in the creatinine level during ICU stay. RESULTS A total of 5037 patients were recruited from 53 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand \textemdash{} 2515 patients were assigned to the BMES group and 2522 to the saline group. Death within 90 days after randomization occurred in 530 of 2433 patients (21.8\%) in the BMES group and in 530 of 2413 patients (22.0\%) in the saline group, for a difference of -0.15 percentage points (95\% confidence interval [CI], -3.60 to 3.30; P\,=\,0.90). New renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 306 of 2403 patients (12.7\%) in the BMES group and in 310 of 2394 patients (12.9\%) in the saline group, for a difference of -0.20 percentage points (95\% CI, -2.96 to 2.56). The mean ({$\pm$}SD) maximum increase in serum creatinine level was 0.41{$\pm$}1.06 mg per deciliter (36.6{$\pm$}94.0 {$\mu$}mol per liter) in the BMES group and 0.41{$\pm$}1.02 mg per deciliter (36.1{$\pm$}90.0 {$\mu$}mol per liter) in the saline group, for a difference of 0.01 mg per deciliter (95\% CI, -0.05 to 0.06) (0.5 {$\mu$}mol per liter [95\% CI, -4.7 to 5.7]).

The pH of the Plasma-Lyte 148 solutions administered in both the BaSICS and SPLIT trials was 7.4, as was the pH of the Plasma-Lyte 148 administered in the recently completed Plasma-Lyte 148 v Saline (PLUS) study. Therefore, the concern that the pH of Plasma-Lyte 148 administered in these trials was responsible for the differences in the study outcomes is unfounded.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The influence of stroke lateralization on functional and cardiovascular outcome after stroke is not well established. We evaluated the influence of hemispheric lateralization among patients enrolled in prospective acute stroke trials. METHODS: We obtained data from the VISTA database for acute stroke trials which reported lateralization. Baseline data, cardiac adverse events, and 90-day outcomes were compared between right and left hemisphere stroke patients. A "hemisphere unbiased" subscore of the NIHSS which omitted items strongly associated with lateralized cognitive deficits was also compared for trials which reported individual NIHSS item scores. A multivariable analysis of outcome predictors was performed. RESULTS: Three acute stroke trials met the prespecified inclusion criteria. 1644 placebo-treated patients with documented hemispheric lateralization were included in the analysis. Baseline NIHSS was higher for left hemisphere patients (mean 16.2, versus 12.8 right, P{$<$}0.001); there was no difference in the "hemisphere unbiased" NIHSS subscore (10.88 left, 11.08 right, n=687, P=0.49). There was no difference between hemispheres in 90-day modified Rankin Score (3.43 left, 3.29 right, P=0.13), mortality (22.1\% left, 19.5\% right, P=0.20), or cardiac adverse events (P=0.71). Hemispheric lateralization was not an independent predictor of outcome in the multivariable analysis after controlling for the hemispheric bias intrinsic to the NIHSS. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in functional outcome between patients with right or left hemisphere stroke. Use of the baseline NIHSS score to predict stroke outcome must take hemispheric lateralization into account. Stroke lateralization is not an important predictor of cardiac adverse events or 90-day mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND It has been hypothesized that in high-transmission settings, malaria control in early childhood ({$<$}5 years of age) might delay the acquisition of functional immunity and shift child deaths from younger to older ages. METHODS We used data from a 22-year prospective cohort study in rural southern Tanzania to estimate the association between early-life use of treated nets and survival to adulthood. All the children born between January 1, 1998, and August 30, 2000, in the study area were invited to enroll in a longitudinal study from 1998 through 2003. Adult survival outcomes were verified in 2019 through community outreach and mobile telephones. We used Cox proportional-hazards models to estimate the association between the use of treated nets in early childhood and survival to adulthood, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS A total of 6706 children were enrolled. In 2019, we verified information on the vital status of 5983 participants (89\%). According to reports of early-life community outreach visits, approximately one quarter of children never slept under a treated net, one half slept under a treated net some of the time, and the remaining quarter always slept under a treated net. Participants who were reported to have used treated nets at half the early-life visits or more had a hazard ratio for death of 0.57 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.72) as compared with those who were reported to have used treated nets at less than half the visits. The corresponding hazard ratio between 5 years of age and adulthood was 0.93 (95\% CI, 0.58 to 1.49). CONCLUSIONS In this long-term study of early-life malaria control in a high-transmission setting, the survival benefit from early-life use of treated nets persisted to adulthood.

Interest in potential WICH treatment trials has grown, but the practicality of such trials has received less attention. We determined the number of patients that would be eligible for enrollment in hypothetical treatment trials for WICH using a population-based study. Methods\textemdash{} We identified all patients aged 18 years or older from the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region with nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage in 2005. Three hypothetical WICH treatment trial criteria sets were used to determine eligibility for enrollment, varying from relatively strict to broadly inclusive. For the hypothetical trials, we assumed the comparison of a standard therapy to an alternative therapy. Sample size calculations assumed different rates of poor outcome depending on the criteria set, various effect sizes, a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, and 80\% power. Given 5 years of trial enrollment, the population base needed to enroll the required subjects was then calculated. Results\textemdash{} Warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage accounted for 54 of 286 (19\%) cases of intracerebral hemorrhage within the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region in 2005. Eligibility rates ranged from 2 of 54 WICH patients (4\% of cases, strictest set) to 11 of 54 WICH patients (20\% of cases, most inclusive set). Given these rates, a population base of at least 67 million persons would be required to conduct a 5-year trial for WICH with a 10\% effect size using a moderately strict criteria set. Conclusions\textemdash{} Any planned treatment trial for WICH should anticipate significant challenges in successfully enrolling adequate numbers of patients.},

  abstract = {Our aim was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of transferring patients with intracerebral hemorrhage from centers without specialized neurological intensive care units (neuro-ICUs) to centers with neuro-ICUs. Decision analytic models were developed for the lifetime horizons. Model inputs were derived from the best available data, informed by a variety of previous cost-effectiveness models of stroke. The effect of neuro-ICU care on functional outcomes was modeled in 3 scenarios. A favorable outcomes scenario was modeled based on the best observational data and compared with moderately favorable and least-favorable outcomes scenarios. Health benefits were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs were estimated from a societal perspective. Costs were combined with QALYs gained to generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. One-way sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test robustness of the model assumptions. Transferring patients to centers with neuro-ICUs yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the lifetime horizon of \$47 431 per QALY, \$91 674 per QALY, and \$380 358 per QALY for favorable, moderately favorable, and least-favorable scenarios, respectively. Models were robust at a willingness-to-pay threshold of \$100 000 per QALY, with 95.5\%, 75.0\%, and 2.1\% of simulations below the threshold for favorable, moderately favorable, and least-favorable scenarios, respectively. Transferring patients with intracerebral hemorrhage to centers with specialized neuro-ICUs is cost-effective if observational estimates of the neuro-ICU\textendash based functional outcome distribution are accurate. If future work confirms these functional outcome distributions, then a strong societal rationale exists to build systems of care designed to transfer intracerebral hemorrhage patients to specialized neuro-ICUs.}

Pressure and flow values can be independent variables that reflect control by the ventilator or dependent variables that demonstrate the respiratory system's response to mechanical ventilation. Diagrams of time-based pressure and flow curves may reveal underlying pathophysiology beyond more commonly assessed parameters such as peak airway pressure, respiratory rate, and tidal volume. In this narrative review, we introduce a stepwise approach clinicians can take to diagnose pulmonary pathophysiology by using ventilator waveforms in patients receiving pressure control ventilation or volume control ventilation. Understanding a patient's pathophysiology (i.e., increased airway resistance) does not distinguish pathology (i.e., kinked endotracheal tube or bronchospasm). A pathology such as pulmonary edema may have more than one pathophysiologic process (i.e., increased airway resistance and low respiratory compliance). To interpret ventilator waveforms, we assume a one-compartment lung model with a linear response to a range of tidal volumes.1 We do not discuss identification of ventilation mode or adaptive ventilation.2},

  abstract = {Summary:~         Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) affects 30,000 people in the Unites States alone each year. Delayed cerebral ischemia occurs days after subarachnoid hemorrhage and represents a potentially treatable cause of morbidity for approximately one-third of those who survive the initial hemorrhage. While vasospasm has been traditionally linked to the development of cerebral ischemia several days after subarachnoid hemorrhage, emerging evidence reveals that delayed cerebral ischemia is part of a much more complicated post\textendash subarachnoid hemorrhage syndrome. The development of delayed cerebral ischemia involves early arteriolar vasospasm with microthrombosis, perfusion mismatch and neurovascular uncoupling, spreading depolarizations, and inflammatory responses that begin at the time of the hemorrhage and evolve over time, culminating in cortical infarction. Large-vessel vasospasm is likely a late contributor to ongoing injury, and effective treatment for delayed cerebral ischemia will require improved detection of critical early pathophysiologic changes as well as therapeutic options that target multiple related pathways.},

Tele-ICU facilitates the standardization of high-quality critical care across the system. A common electronic medical record made the communications among the ICUs feasible. Combining faculty from medical and surgical critical care divisions increased the productivity of intensivists.Study DesignWe retrospectively reviewed the administrative database data from 2011 and 2012, including mean census, number of transfers, age, sex, case mix index, mortality, readmissions, and financial data.ResultsThe Critical Care program has 106 adult ICU beds; 54 of those beds can be managed remotely using tele-ICU based at the main University hospital. The mean midnight census of the system for 2012 was 69.44 and total patient-days were 34,406. The capital cost of the tele-ICU was \$1,186,220. The annual operational cost is \$1,250,112 or \$23,150 per monitored ICU-bed. Unadjusted mortality was 6.5\% before and 4.9\% after implementation (p {$<$} 0.0002).ConclusionsWe describe a novel health system level ICU program built using ``off the shelf'' technology based on a large University medical center and a tele-ICU with a full degree of treatment authority across the system.},

  abstract = {Background: There are limited data on the trajectory of recovery and long-term functional outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Most ICH trials have conventionally assessed outcomes at 3 months following the footsteps of ischemic stroke. The i-DEF trial (Intracerebral Hemorrhage Deferoxamine Trial) assessed modified Rankin Scale (mRS) longitudinally at prespecified time points from day 7 through the end of the 6-month follow-up period. We evaluated the trajectory of mRS among trial participants and examined the effect of deferoxamine on this trajectory. Methods: We performed a post hoc analysis of the i-DEF trial, a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, futility-design, phase 2 clinical trial, based on the actual treatment received. Favorable outcome was defined as mRS score of 0\textendash 2. A generalized linear mixed model was used to evaluate the outcome trajectory over time, as well as whether the trajectory was altered by deferoxamine, after adjustments for randomization variables, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, and ICH location. Results: A total of 291 subjects were included in analysis (145 placebo and 146 deferoxamine). The proportion of patients with mRS score of 0\textendash 2 continually increased from day 7 to 180 in both groups (interaction P{$<$}0.0001 for time in main effects model), but treatment with deferoxamine favorably altered the trajectory (interaction P=0.0010). Between day 90 and 180, the deferoxamine group improved (P=0.0001), whereas there was not significant improvement in the placebo arm (P=0.3005). Conclusions: A large proportion of patients continue to improve up to 6 months after ICH. Future ICH trials should assess outcomes past 90 days for a minimum of 6 months. In i-DEF, treatment with deferoxamine seemed to accelerate and alter the trajectory of recovery as assessed by mRS.

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lurasidone compared with quetiapine for treatment of delirium in critically ill patients. Design: Prospective, observational cohort study. Setting: Single-center community teaching hospital. Patients: Forty adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients with delirium (Confusion Assessment Method in the ICU positive), tolerating enteral nutrition, and without active alcohol withdrawal or prior use of atypical antipsychotics. Interventions: Patients were treated at the discretion of the prescriber with either lurasidone or quetiapine for delirium. Dose escalation and/or discontinuation were determined at the discretion of individual providers. Results: Baseline characteristics differed with a higher severity of illness in patients in the quetiapine group (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 20) and a higher baseline QTc interval in the lurasidone group (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 20). No significant difference was seen in the time to delirium resolution (3.2 vs 3.4 days), average daily haloperidol requirements (5.7 vs 6.9 mg), hospital length of stay (LOS; 23.6 vs 27.9 days), or ICU LOS (12.1 vs 14.2 days). Lurasidone was associated with fewer ventilator support days (4.0 [interquartile range, IQR: 2.3-6.8] days vs 7 [IQR: 4.0-9.8; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .0295] days) but also a fewer number of deliriumfree days (0 [IQR: 0-1.0] days vs 2 [IQR: 0-3.0; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .0231] days). Additionally, no difference was seen for ICU mortality (20\% vs 20\%), percentage of time oversedated (2.8\% vs 2.7\%), or incidence of QTc prolongation (10.0\% vs 10.0\%). Conclusions: Lurasidone for the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients did not differ in the time to delirium resolution when compared to quetiapine. Additionally, the incidence of QTc prolongation between agents does not appear to be different. Future randomized trials should evaluate dose escalation schemes and a larger proportion of patients to evaluate differences in mortality, efficacy, and life-threatening arrhythmias associated with atypical antipsychotic use.},

As such, the ability to simulate data represents a critical set of skills that epidemiologists should use to better understand epidemiologic concepts and ensure that they have the tools to continue to self-teach even when their formal instruction ends. Simulation methods are not always taught in epidemiology methods courses, whereas causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) often are. Therefore, this paper details an approach to building simulations from DAGs and provides examples and code for learning to perform simulations. We recommend using very simple DAGs to learn the procedures and code necessary to set up a simulation that builds on key concepts frequently of interest to epidemiologists (e.g., mediation, confounding bias, M bias). We believe that following this approach will allow epidemiologists to gain confidence with a critical skill set that may in turn have a positive impact on how they conduct future epidemiologic studies.},

  abstract = {Background: Regulators are evaluating the use of non-interventional real-world evidence (RWE) studies to assess the effectiveness of medical products. The RCT-DUPLICATE initiative uses a structured process to design RWE studies emulating randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and compare results. Here, we report findings of the first 10 trial emulations, evaluating cardiovascular outcomes of antidiabetic or antiplatelet medications. Methods: We selected 3 active-controlled and 7 placebo-controlled RCTs for replication. Using patient-level claims data from US commercial and Medicare payers, we implemented inclusion/exclusion criteria, selected primary endpoints, and comparator populations to emulate those of each corresponding RCT. Within the trial-mimicking populations, we conducted propensity score matching to control for {$>$}120 pre-exposure confounders. All study parameters were prospectively defined and protocols registered before hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. Success criteria for the primary analysis were prespecified for each replication. Results: Despite attempts to emulate RCT design as closely as possible, differences between the RCT and corresponding RWE study populations remained. The regulatory conclusions were equivalent in 6 of 10. The RWE emulations achieved a HR estimate that was within the 95\% CI from the corresponding RCT in 8 of 10 studies. In 9 of 10, either the regulatory or estimate agreement success criteria were fulfilled. The largest differences in effect estimates were found for RCTs where second-generation sulfonylureas were used as a proxy for placebo regarding cardiovascular effects. Nine of 10 replications had a standardized difference between effect estimates of {$<$}2, which suggests differences within expected random variation. Conclusions: Agreement between RCT and RWE findings varies depending on which agreement metric is used. Interim findings indicate that selection of active comparator therapies with similar indications and use patterns enhances the validity of RWE. Even in the context of active comparators, concordance between RCT and RWE findings is not guaranteed, partially because trials are not emulated exactly. More trial emulations are needed to understand how often and in what contexts RWE findings match RCTs.

  abstract = {Objectives: The postoperative management of patients who undergo brain tumor resection frequently occurs in an ICU. However, the routine admission of all patients to an ICU following surgery is controversial. This study seeks to identify the frequency with which patients undergoing elective supratentorial tumor resection require care, aside from frequent neurologic checks, that is specific to an ICU and to determine the frequency of new complications during ICU admission. Additionally, clinical predictors of ICU-specific care are identified, and a scoring system to discriminate patients most likely to require ICU-specific treatment is validated. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Academic neurosurgical center. Patients: Two-hundred consecutive adult patients who underwent supratentorial brain tumor surgery. An additional 100 consecutive patients were used to validate the prediction score. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Univariate statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify clinical characteristics associated with ICU-specific treatment. Eighteen patients (9\&percnt;) received ICU-specific care, and 19 (9.5\&percnt;) experienced new complications or underwent emergent imaging while in the ICU. Factors significantly associated with ICU-specific care included nonelective admission, preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale, and volume of IV fluids. A simple clinical scoring system that included Karnofsky Performance Status less than 70 (1 point), general endotracheal anesthesia (1 point), and any early postoperative complications (2 points) demonstrated excellent ability to discriminate patients who required ICU-specific care in both the derivation and validation cohorts. Conclusions: Less than 10\&percnt; of patients required ICU-specific care following supratentorial tumor resection. A simple clinical scoring system may aid clinicians in stratifying the risk of requiring ICU care and could inform triage decisions when ICU bed availability is limited.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Pivotal trials of percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) used specific postprocedure treatment protocols. OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate patterns of postprocedure care after LAAO with the Watchman device in clinical practice and compare the risk of adverse events for different discharge antithrombotic strategies. METHODS We evaluated patients in the LAAO Registry of the National Cardiovascular Data Registry who underwent LAAO with the Watchman device between 2016 and 2018. We assessed adherence to the full postprocedure trial protocol including standardized follow-up, imaging, and antithrombotic agents and then evaluated the most commonly used antithrombotic strategies and compared the rates and risk of adverse events at 45 days and 6 months by means of multivariable COX frailty regression. RESULTS Among 31,994 patients undergoing successful LAAO, only 12.2\% received the full postprocedure treatment protocol studied in pivotal trials; the most common protocol deviations were with discharge antithrombotic medications. The most common discharge medication strategies were warfarin and aspirin (36.9\%), direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and aspirin (20.8\%), warfarin only (13.5\%), DOAC only (12.3\%), and dual antiplatelet therapy (5.0\%). In multivariable Cox frailty regression, the adjusted risk of any adverse event through the 45-day follow-up visit were significantly lower for discharge on warfarin alone (HR: 0.692; 95\% CI: 0.569-0.841) and DOAC alone (HR: 0.731; 95\% CI: 0.574-0.930) compared with warfarin and aspirin. Warfarin alone retained lower risk at the 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In contemporary U.S. practice, practitioners rarely used the full U.S. Food and Drug Administration\textendash approved postprocedure treatment protocols studied in pivotal trials of the Watchman device. Discharge after implantation on warfarin or DOAC without concomitant aspirin was associated with lower risk of adverse outcomes.

  abstract = {Background: The responsibility for helping patients understand potential health benefits and risks, especially regarding screening tests, falls largely to general practitioners (GPs). The Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT) specifically measures risk literacy (i.e., the ability to understand different aspects of statistical numeracy associated with accurate interpretation of information about risks). This study explored the association between risk literacy levels and clinical experience in GPs vs. medical students. Additionally, the effect of GP risk literacy on evaluation of the predictive value of screening tests was examined. Methods: The participants were 84 GPs and 92 third-year medical students who completed the BNT (total score range 0\textendash 4 points). The GPs received an additional case scenario on mammography screening as a simple measure of performance in applying numeracy skills. Results: Despite having an average of 25.9 years of clinical experience, GPs scored no better than medical students on risk literacy (GPs: 2.33 points, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.08\textendash 2.59; students: 2.34, 95\% CI 2.07\textendash 2.61; P = .983). Of all GPs, 71.6\% (n = 58) greatly overestimated the real predictive value. Conclusions: In this study, we found no difference in risk literacy between current students and current GPs. GPs lack risk literacy and consequently do not fully understand numeric estimates of probability in routine screening procedures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The questions patients are asked about their preferences with regard to life-sustaining treatment usually focus on specific interventions, but the outcomes of treatment and their likelihood affect patients' preferences. METHODS: We administered a questionnaire about treatment preferences to 226 persons who were 60 years of age or older and who had a limited life expectancy due to cancer, congestive heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study participants were asked whether they would want to receive a given treatment, first when the outcome was known with certainty and then with different likelihoods of an adverse outcome. The outcome without treatment was specified as death from the underlying disease. RESULTS: The burden of treatment (i.e., the length of the hospital stay, extent of testing, and invasiveness of interventions), the outcome, and the likelihood of the outcome all influenced treatment preferences. For a low-burden treatment with the restoration of current health, 98.7 percent of participants said they would choose to receive the treatment (rather than not receive it and die), but 11.2 percent of these participants would not choose the treatment if it had a high burden. If the outcome was survival but with severe functional impairment or cognitive impairment, 74.4 percent and 88.8 percent of these participants, respectively, would not choose treatment. The number of participants who said they would choose treatment declined as the likelihood of an adverse outcome increased, with fewer participants choosing treatment when the possible outcome was functional or cognitive impairment than when it was death. Preferences did not differ according to the primary diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Advance care planning should take into account patients' attitudes toward the burden of treatment, the possible outcomes, and their likelihood. The likelihood of adverse functional and cognitive outcomes of treatment requires explicit consideration.},

  abstract = {The historical hypothesis of sterility of the lungs was invalidated over a decade ago when studies demonstrated the existence of sparse but very diverse bacterial populations in the normal lung and the association between pulmonary dysbiosis and chronic respiratory diseases. Under mechanical ventilation, dysbiosis occurs rapidly with a gradual decline in diversity over time and the progressive predominance of a bacterial pathogen (mainly Proteobacteria) when lung infection occurs. During acute respiratory distress syndrome, an enrichment in bacteria of intestinal origin, mainly Enterobacteriaceae, is observed. However, the role of this dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of ventilator-associated pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome is not yet fully understood. The lack of exploration of other microbial populations, viruses (eukaryotes and prokaryotes) and fungi is a key issue. Further analysis of the interaction between these microbial kingdoms and a better understanding of the host-microbiome interaction are necessary to fully elucidate the role of the microbiome in the pathogenicity of acute diseases. The validation of a consensual and robust methodology in order to make the comparison of the different studies relevant is also required. Filling these different gaps should help develop preventive and therapeutic strategies for both acute respiratory distress syndrome and ventilator-associated pneumonia.},

  abstract = {Objectives:~         To describe unique features of neurocritical illness that are relevant to provision of high-quality palliative care; to discuss key prognostic aids and their limitations for neurocritical illnesses; to review challenges and strategies for establishing realistic goals of care for patients in the neuro-ICU; and to describe elements of best practice concerning symptom management, limitation of life support, and organ donation for the neurocritically ill.         Data Sources:~         A search of PubMed and MEDLINE was conducted from inception through January 2015 for all English-language articles using the term ``palliative care,'' ``supportive care,'' ``end-of-life care,'' ``withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,'' ``limitation of life support,'' ``prognosis,'' or ``goals of care'' together with ``neurocritical care,'' ``neurointensive care,'' ``neurological,'' ``stroke,'' ``subarachnoid hemorrhage,'' ``intracerebral hemorrhage,'' or ``brain injury.''         Data Extraction and Synthesis:~         We reviewed the existing literature on delivery of palliative care in the neurointensive care unit setting, focusing on challenges and strategies for establishing realistic and appropriate goals of care, symptom management, organ donation, and other considerations related to use and limitation of life-sustaining therapies for neurocritically ill patients. Based on review of these articles and the experiences of our interdisciplinary/interprofessional expert advisory board, this report was prepared to guide critical care staff, palliative care specialists, and others who practice in this setting.         Conclusions:~         Most neurocritically ill patients and their families face the sudden onset of devastating cognitive and functional changes that challenge clinicians to provide patient-centered palliative care within a complex and often uncertain prognostic environment. Application of palliative care principles concerning symptom relief, goal setting, and family emotional support will provide clinicians a framework to address decision making at a time of crisis that enhances patient/family autonomy and clinician professionalism.},

We aimed to identify the prevalence, etiologies, and mortality rates associated with TME in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We conducted a retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study among patients with reverse transcriptase\textendash polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized at four New York City hospitals in the same health network between March 1, 2020, and May 20, 2020. TME was diagnosed in patients with altered mental status off sedation or after an adequate sedation washout. Patients with structural brain disease, seizures, or primary neurological diagnoses were excluded. The coprimary outcomes were the prevalence of TME stratified by etiology and in-hospital mortality (excluding comfort care only patients) assessed by using a multivariable time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age, race, sex, intubation, intensive care unit requirement, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, hospital location, and date of admission. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Among 4491 patients with COVID-19, 559 (12\%) were diagnosed with TME, of whom 435 of 559 (78\%) developed encephalopathy immediately prior to hospital admission. The most common etiologies were septic encephalopathy (n\,=\,247 of 559 [62\%]), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (n\,=\,331 of 559 [59\%]), and uremia (n\,=\,156 of 559 [28\%]). Multiple etiologies were present in 435 (78\%) patients. Compared with those without TME (n\,=\,3932), patients with TME were older (76 vs. 62 years), had dementia (27\% vs. 3\%) or psychiatric history (20\% vs. 10\%), were more often intubated (37\% vs. 20\%), had a longer hospital length of stay (7.9 vs. 6.0 days), and were less often discharged home (25\% vs. 66\% [all P\,{$<$}\,0.001]). Excluding comfort care patients (n\,=\,267 of 4491 [6\%]) and after adjustment for confounders, TME remained associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (n\,=\,128 of 425 [30\%] patients with TME died, compared with n\,=\,600 of 3799 [16\%] patients without TME; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.24, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.02\textendash 1.52, P\,=\,0.031), and TME due to hypoxemia conferred the highest risk (n\,=\,97 of 233 [42\%] patients with HIE died, compared with n\,=\,631 of 3991 [16\%] patients without HIE; aHR 1.56, 95\% CI 1.21\textendash 2.00, P\,=\,0.001). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} TME occurred in one in eight hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was typically multifactorial, and was most often due to hypoxemia, sepsis, and uremia. After we adjustment for confounding factors, TME was associated with a 24\% increased risk of in-hospital mortality.},

The first patient was enrolled on May 8, 2018, and the last on July 9, 2019. The final date of follow-up was October 6, 2019.Patients were randomized to the intervention group (n\,=\,109), consisting of intravenous vitamin C (1.5 g every 6 hours), hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 hours), and thiamine (200 mg every 12 hours), or to the control group (n\,=\,107), consisting of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 hours) alone until shock resolution or up to 10 days.The primary trial outcome was duration of time alive and free of vasopressor administration up to day 7. Ten secondary outcomes were prespecified, including 90-day mortality.Among 216 patients who were randomized, 211 provided consent and completed the primary outcome measurement (mean age, 61.7 years [SD, 15.0]; 133 men [63\%]). Time alive and vasopressor free up to day 7 was 122.1 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 76.3-145.4 hours) in the intervention group and 124.6 hours (IQR, 82.1-147.0 hours) in the control group; the median of all paired differences was \textendash 0.6 hours (95\% CI, \textendash 8.3 to 7.2 hours; P\,=\,.83). Of 10 prespecified secondary outcomes, 9 showed no statistically significant difference. Ninety-day mortality was 30/105 (28.6\%) in the intervention group and 25/102 (24.5\%) in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95\% CI, 0.69-2.00). No serious adverse events were reported.In patients with septic shock, treatment with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine, compared with intravenous hydrocortisone alone, did not significantly improve the duration of time alive and free of vasopressor administration over 7 days. The finding suggests that treatment with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine does not lead to a more rapid resolution of septic shock compared with intravenous hydrocortisone alone.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03333278},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of HES 130/0.4 compared with 0.9\% saline for intravascular volume expansion on mortality and postoperative complications after major abdominal surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial of 775 adult patients at increased risk of postoperative kidney injury undergoing major abdominal surgery at 20 university hospitals in France from February 2016 to July 2018; final follow-up was in October 2018. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive fluid containing either 6\% HES 130/0.4 diluted in 0.9\% saline (n = 389) or 0.9\% saline alone (n = 386) in 250-mL boluses using an individualized hemodynamic algorithm during surgery and for up to 24 hours on the first postoperative day, defined as ending at 7:59 AM the following day. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite of death or major postoperative complications at 14 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes included predefined postoperative complications within 14 days after surgery, durations of intensive care unit and hospital stays, and all-cause mortality at postoperative days 28 and 90. RESULTS Among 826 patients enrolled (mean age, 68 [SD, 7] years; 91 women [12\%]), 775 (94\%) completed the trial. The primary outcome occurred in 139 of 389 patients (36\%) in the HES group and 125 of 386 patients (32\%) in the saline group (difference, 3.3\% [95\% CI, -3.3\% to 10.0\%]; relative risk, 1.10 [95\% CI, 0.91-1.34]; P = .33). Among 12 prespecified secondary outcomes reported, 11 showed no significant difference, but a statistically significant difference was found in median volume of study fluid administered on day 1: 1250 mL (interquartile range, 750-2000 mL) in the HES group and 1500 mL (interquartile range, 750-2150 mL) in the saline group (median difference, 250 mL [95\% CI, 83-417 mL]; P = .006). At 28 days after surgery, 4.1\% and 2.3\% of patients had died in the HES and saline groups, respectively (difference, 1.8\% [95\% CI, -0.7\% to 4.3\%]; relative risk, 1.76 [95\% CI, 0.79-3.94]; P = .17). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients at risk of postoperative kidney injury undergoing major abdominal surgery, use of HES for volume replacement therapy compared with 0.9\% saline resulted in no significant difference in a composite outcome of death or major postoperative complications within 14 days after surgery. These findings do not support the use of HES for volume replacement therapy in such patients.},

Main outcome measures                                The strict design criteria of a clinical trial were mimicked by using the cloning, censoring, and weighting method to eliminate immortal time bias, lead time bias, and survivor bias. A dynamic marginal structural model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and absolute risks for five year all cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) for 15 dialysis initiation strategies with eGFR values between 4 and 19 mL/min/1.73 m                 2                 in increments of 1 mL/min/1.73 m                 2                 . An eGFR between 6 and 7 mL/min/1.73 m                 2                 (eGFR                 6-7                 ) was taken as the reference.                                                        Results                                Among 10\,290 incident patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (median age 73 years; 3739 (36\%) women; median eGFR 16.8 mL/min/1.73 m                 2                 ), 3822 started dialysis, 4160 died, and 2446 had a major adverse cardiovascular event. A parabolic relation was observed for mortality, with the lowest risk for eGFR                 15-16                 . Compared with dialysis initiation at eGFR                 6-7                 , initiation at eGFR                 15-16                 was associated with a 5.1\% (95\% confidence interval 2.5\% to 6.9\%) lower absolute five year mortality risk and 2.9\% (0.2\% to 5.5\%) lower risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event, corresponding to hazard ratios of 0.89 (95\% confidence interval 0.87 to 0.92) and 0.94 (0.91 to 0.98), respectively. This 5.1\% absolute risk difference corresponded to a mean postponement of death of 1.6 months over five years of follow-up. However, dialysis would need to be started four years earlier. When emulating the intended strategies of the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) trial (eGFR                 10-14                 v                 eGFR                 5-7                 ) and the achieved eGFRs in IDEAL (eGFR                 7-10                 v                 eGFR                 5-7                 ), hazard ratios for all cause mortality were 0.96 (0.94 to 0.99) and 0.97 (0.94 to 1.00), respectively, which are congruent with the findings of the randomised IDEAL trial.                                                        Conclusions               Very early initiation of dialysis was associated with a modest reduction in mortality and cardiovascular events. For most patients, such a reduction may not outweigh the burden of a substantially longer period spent on dialysis.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review~         Intravenous fluid is a fundamental component of trauma care and fluid management influences patient outcomes. This narrative review appraises recent clinical studies of fluid therapy in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), with respect to its use in volume resuscitation and prevention of secondary injury.         Recent findings~         Despite the development of level 1 evidence in fluid resuscitation, in patients with TBI key questions concerning optimal composition and volume remain unanswered. In the absence of randomized trials demonstrating patient outcome differences, clinical practice is often based on physiological principles and surrogate endpoints. There is a physiological rationale why excessive fluid administration and positive fluid balance may increase brain swelling and intracranial pressure (ICP); in some patients, a lower cumulative fluid balance may improve outcomes, but limited human data exist. Resuscitation with 4\% albumin in TBI patients in ICU worsens mortality, which may be mediated by increased ICP during the first week after injury. Hypertonic saline and mannitol decrease ICP, but may not improve survival or neurological outcomes. Sodium lactate may be a future therapy for treatment and prevention of secondary brain injury.         Summary~         In patients with TBI, intravenous fluids are integral to management; they may be both a source of harm and a potential therapy to limit secondary brain injury. They should be prescribed in accordance with other pharmaceutical or therapeutic interventions. Refined usage may improve patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: No randomized, controlled trials of screening colonoscopy have been completed, and ongoing trials exclude persons aged 75 years or older. The Medicare program, however, reimburses screening colonoscopy without an upper age limit. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of screening colonoscopy to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) in persons aged 70 to 74 and those aged 75 to 79 years. DESIGN: Large-scale, population-based, prospective study. The observational data were used to emulate a target trial with 2 groups: colonoscopy screening and no screening. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: 1~355~692 Medicare beneficiaries (2004 to 2012) aged 70 to 79 years at average risk for CRC who used Medicare preventive services and had no previous diagnostic or surveillance colonoscopies in the past 5 years. MEASUREMENTS: 8-year risk for CRC and 30-day risk for adverse events. RESULTS: In beneficiaries aged 70 to 74 years, the 8-year risk for CRC was 2.19\% (95\% CI, 2.00\% to 2.37\%) in the screening colonoscopy group and 2.62\% (CI, 2.56\% to 2.67\%) in the no-screening group (absolute risk difference, -0.42\% [CI, -0.24\% to -0.63\%]). Among those aged 75 to 79 years, the 8-year risk for CRC was 2.84\% (CI, 2.54\% to 3.13\%) in the screening colonoscopy group and 2.97\% (CI, 2.92\% to 3.03\%) in the no-screening group (risk difference, -0.14\% [CI, -0.41 to 0.16]). The excess 30-day risk for any adverse event in the colonoscopy group was 5.6 events per 1000 individuals (CI, 4.4 to 6.8) in the 70- to 74-year age group and 10.3 per 1000 (CI, 8.6 to 11.1) in the 75- to 79-year age group. LIMITATION: CRC-specific mortality was not available, but CRC incidence and stage were studied at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Screening colonoscopy may have had a modest benefit in preventing CRC in beneficiaries aged 70 to 74 years and a smaller benefit in older beneficiaries. The risk for adverse events was low but greater among older persons. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institutes of Health.},

A frequent goal of these observational analyses is to use the data to emulate a hypothetical randomized experiment, i.e., the target trial, that mimics the design features of a true experiment, including a clear definition of time zero with synchronization of treatment assignment and determination of eligibility. We review a recent observational analysis that explicitly emulated a target trial of screening colonoscopy using insurance claims from U.S. Medicare. We then compare this explicit emulation with alternative, simpler observational analyses that do not synchronize treatment assignment and eligibility determination at time zero and/or do not allow for repeated eligibility. This empirical comparison suggests that lack of an explicit emulation of the target trial leads to biased estimates, and shows that allowing for repeated eligibility increases the statistical efficiency of the estimates.},

A detailed description of missing outcome data (MOD) due to participant loss to follow-up has never been published. The objective of this study was to perform a methodlogical survey on missing outcome data in an alteplase for ischemic stroke meta-analysis. Materials and Methods A methodological survey was performed on a chosen meta-analysis of alteplase for ischemic stroke RCTs that most closely aligns with recent national guideline recommendations. Data were collected to assess the number of participants lost to follow-up; differential lost to follow-up between allocation groups; baseline characteristics of those lost to follow-up; and the imputation methods used by individual trials and the chosen meta-analysis. The number of participants lost to follow-up was compared with the fragility index; and repeated for individually positive RCTs in the meta-analysis. Results The methodological survey revealed a substantial degree of missing information regarding MOD in the chosen meta-analysis and in individual RCTs. Single imputation was exclusively used in all RCTs and in the meta-analysis. The number of participants lost to follow-up was greater than the fragility index in the chosen meta-analysis and individually positive component RCTs suggesting that MOD may impact the direction of the reported effect or effect size. Conclusion This methodological survey of an alteplase for ischemic stroke meta-analysis revealed MOD may be an important source of unrecognized bias. This survey highlights the need for sensitivity analyses using more robust methods of imputation.},

  abstract = {Objectives To describe and summarise how the results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that did not find a significant treatment effect are reported, and to estimate how commonly trial reports make unwarranted claims. Design We performed a retrospective survey of published RCTs, published in four high impact factor general medical journals between June 2016 and June 2017. Setting Trials conducted in all settings were included. Participants 94 reports of RCTs that did not find a difference in their main comparison or comparisons were included. Interventions All interventions. Primary and secondary outcomes We recorded the way the results of each trial for its primary outcome or outcomes were described in Results and Conclusions sections of the Abstract, using a 10-category classification. Other outcomes were whether confidence intervals (CIs) and p values were presented for the main treatment comparisons, and whether the results and conclusions referred to measures of uncertainty. We estimated the proportion of papers that made claims that were not justified by the results, or were open to multiple interpretations. Results 94 trial reports (120 treatment comparisons) were included. In Results sections, for 58/120 comparisons (48.3\%) the results of the study were re-stated, without interpretation, and 38/120 (31.7\%) stated that there was no statistically significant difference. In Conclusions, 65/120 treatment comparisons (54.2\%) stated that there was no treatment benefit, 14/120 (11.7\%) that there was no significant benefit and 16/120 (13.3\%) that there was no significant difference. CIs and p values were both presented by 84\% of studies (79/94), but only 3/94 studies referred to uncertainty when drawing conclusions. Conclusions The majority of trials (54.2\%) inappropriately interpreted a result that was not statistically significant as indicating no treatment benefit. Very few studies interpreted the result as indicating a lack of evidence against the null hypothesis of zero difference between the trial arms.},

Bayesian inference is a natural way to propagate these uncertainties, with hierarchical modelling capturing variation in these parameters across experiments. Another concern is the people in the sample not being representative of the general population. Statistical adjustment cannot without strong assumptions correct for selection bias in an opt-in sample, but multilevel regression and post-stratification can at least adjust for known differences between the sample and the population. We demonstrate hierarchical regression and post-stratification models with code in Stan and discuss their application to a controversial recent study of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a sample of people from the Stanford University area. Wide posterior intervals make it impossible to evaluate the quantitative claims of that study regarding the number of unreported infections. For future studies, the methods described here should facilitate more accurate estimates of disease prevalence from imperfect tests performed on non-representative samples.},

However, in a world in which measurements are noisy and effects are small, this will not work: selection on statistical significance leads to effect sizes which are overestimated and often in the wrong direction. After a brief discussion of two examples, one in economics and one in social psychology, we consider the procedural solution of open post-publication review, the design solution of devoting more effort to accurate measurements and within-person comparisons, and the statistical analysis solution of multilevel modeling and reporting all results rather than selection on significance. We argue that the current replication crisis in science arises in part from the ill effects of null hypothesis significance testing being used to study small effects with noisy data. In such settings, apparent success comes easy but truly replicable results require a more serious connection between theory, measurement, and data.},

  abstract = {Rationale: The epidemiology of continuous ketamine use in the management of critically ill adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) in the United States is unknown. Objectives: To quantify temporal trends and variation across U.S. hospitals in continuous ketamine use. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adults (age\,{$\geq$}\,18 yr) receiving MV who were discharged (alive or dead) from U.S. hospitals contributing data to the Premier Healthcare Database between January 2008 and September 2018. We used mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression modeling (fixed effects: patient and hospital characteristics; random effect: discharge hospital) to evaluate the associations of discharge quarter and discharge hospital with continuous ketamine use (defined as a charge for intravenous ketamine on {$\geq$}2 consecutive calendar days). Results: We identified 2,059,599 adults receiving MV across 842 hospitals; of these, 7,927 (0.4\%) received continuous ketamine. Ketamine use increased over time from 0.07\% of all patients in quarter 1 of 2008 to 1.1\% of all patients in quarter 3 of 2018. After adjustment, the odds of receiving continuous ketamine were consistently increased starting in quarter 4 of 2011 (odds ratio, 1.83 [95\% confidence interval, 1.09\textendash 3.06] vs. quarter 1 of 2008; P\,=\,0.023), with more than 10-fold increased odds starting in quarter 2 of 2017. Among 842 hospitals, 486 (57.7\%) used continuous ketamine on at least one cohort patient during the study period. Across these hospitals ever using ketamine, median use was 0.2\% (interquartile range, 0.08\textendash 0.5\%), with 5 hospitals using continuous ketamine in {$>$}5\% of patients. The adjusted median odds ratio for discharge hospital was 3.72 (95\% confidence interval, 3.37\textendash 4.13), which was higher than the odds ratio for any patient or hospital covariable other than discharge quarter. Conclusions: In U.S. hospitals, use of continuous infusion ketamine increased markedly over time in critically ill patients receiving MV, with substantial variability among hospitals. Given the unique properties of ketamine as a sedative, further research is needed to assess its safety and utility in critically ill populations.},

Secondary: to explore associations of 1) clinician, family, or patient characteristics with clinicians' prognostication approaches and 2) prognostication approach and WOLST. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Forty-three audio-recorded clinician-family meetings during which prognosis was discussed from seven U.S. centers for 39 CINPs with 88 family members and 27 clinicians. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Two investigators qualitatively coded transcripts using inductive methods (inter-rater reliability {$>$} 80\%) to characterize how clinicians prognosticate. We then applied univariate and multivariable multinomial and binomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Clinicians used four distinct prognostication approaches: Authoritative (21\%; recommending treatments without discussing values and preferences); Informational (23\%; disclosing just the prognosis without further discussions); advisory (42\%; disclosing prognosis followed by discussion of values and preferences); and responsive (14\%; eliciting values and preferences, then disclosing prognosis). Before adjustment, prognostication approach was associated with center (p {$<$} 0.001), clinician specialty (neurointensivists vs non-neurointensivists; p = 0.001), patient age (p = 0.08), diagnosis (p = 0.059), and meeting length (p = 0.03). After adjustment, only clinician specialty independently predicted prognostication approach (p = 0.027). WOLST decisions occurred in 41\% of patients and were most common under the advisory approach (56\%). WOLST was more likely in older patients (p = 0.059) and with more experienced clinicians (p = 0.07). Prognostication approach was not independently associated with WOLST (p = 0.198). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: It is feasible to audio-record sensitive clinician-family meetings about CINPs in multiple ICUs. We found that clinicians prognosticate with high variability. Our data suggest that larger studies are warranted in CINPs to examine the role of clinicians' variable prognostication in WOLST decisions.},

  abstract = {Background: Observational studies have found an increased risk of adverse effects such as hemorrhage, stroke, and increased mortality in patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The impact of prior use of these medications on outcomes in critically ill patients has not been previously examined. We performed a retrospective study to determine if preadmission use of SSRIs or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) is associated with mortality differences in patients admitted to the ICU. Methods: The retrospective study used a modifiable data mining technique applied to the publicly available Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) 2.6 database. A total of 14,709 patient records, consisting of 2,471 in the SSRI/SNRI group and 12,238 control subjects, were analyzed. The study outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: After adjustment for age, Simplified Acute Physiology Score, vasopressor use, ventilator use, and combined Elixhauser score, SSRI/SNRI use was associated with significantly increased in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.19; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.40; P 5 .026). Among patient subgroups, risk was highest in patients with acute coronary syndrome (OR, 1.95; 95\% CI, 1.21-3.13; P 5 .006) and patients admitted to the cardiac surgery recovery unit (OR, 1.51; 95\% CI, 1.11-2.04; P 5 .008). Mortality appeared to vary by specific SSRI, with higher mortalities associated with higher levels of serotonin inhibition. Conclusions: We found significant increases in hospital stay mortality among those patients in the ICU taking SSRI/SNRIs prior to admission as compared with control subjects. Mortality was higher in patients receiving SSRI/SNRI agents that produce greater degrees of serotonin reuptake inhibition. The study serves to demonstrate the potential for the future application of advanced data examination techniques upon detailed (and growing) clinical databases being made available by the digitization of medicine.},

  abstract = {As reflected in the amount of controversy, few areas in psychology have undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in the past decade as the emerging science of heuristics. Heuristics are efficient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that ignore part of the information. Because using heuristics saves effort, the classical view has been that heuristic decisions imply greater errors than do ``rational'' decisions as defined by logic or statistical models. However, for many decisions, the assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function in an uncertain world. To answer both the descriptive question (``Which heuristics do people use in which situations?'') and the prescriptive question (``When should people rely on a given heuristic rather than a complex strategy to make better judgments?''), formal models are indispensable. We review research that tests formal models of heuristic inference, including in business organizations, health care, and legal institutions. This research indicates that (a) individuals and organizations often rely on simple heuristics in an adaptive way, and (b) ignoring part of the information can lead to more accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information, for instance for low predictability and small samples. The big future challenge is to develop a systematic theory of the building blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities and environmental structures these exploit.},

What I call the ``null ritual'' consists of three steps: (1) set up a statistical null hypothesis, but do not specify your own hypothesis nor any alternative hypothesis, (2) use the 5\% significance level for rejecting the null and accepting your hypothesis, and (3) always perform this procedure. I report evidence of the resulting collective confusion and fears about sanctions on the part of students and teachers, researchers and editors, as well as textbook writers.},

Except for results of the open-label, single-arm ANNEXA-4 study, published real-world utilization of andexanet alfa is limited. We present our experience with andexanet alfa use in factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage. The objective of this study was to assess the hemostatic efficacy and safety following early implementation of andexanet alfa use in factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage. Methods: Single center, retrospective, observational study at a large community teaching hospital and Comprehensive Stroke Center. Consecutive patients with factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage, spontaneous or traumatic, treated with andexanet alfa. Primary outcome was hemostatic efficacy established by categories of hematoma growth between baseline and follow-up head computerized tomography after andexanet alfa treatment. Safety outcomes included inpatient mortality and 30-day readmission due to a thromboembolic event. Consecutive factor Xa inhibitor associated intracranial hemorrhage treated with andexanet alfa presenting between June 2018 and December 2019 were included. Results: Thirty-nine patients with mean age of 81.9 years and median baseline Glasgow Coma Score of 14 were evaluated. Median (IQR) baseline intracerebral hematoma volume was 7.1 mL (2.3-28.5), while baseline thickness for subdural hemorrhage was 12.5 mm (8.0-19.3). In 35 of 39 patients with repeat computerized tomography prior to surgical intervention, excellent/good hemostatic efficacy was seen in 29 (82.9\%). Excluded from the hemostatic efficacy estimate were four trauma patients who underwent hematoma evacuation prior to repeat head computerized tomography, nevertheless they had excellent hemostatic effectiveness without perioperative complications or rebleeding. Four (10.3\%) patients died during hospitalization and two (5.1\%) thrombotic events were observed. Conclusions: In this cohort of a real-world utilization of andexanet alfa for reversal of factor Xa inhibitors in patients presenting with intracranial hemorrhage, we observed a high excellent/good hemostatic efficacy rate and lower than reported inpatient mortality and 30-day readmission due to thromboembolism consistent with the findings reported in ANNEXA-4 study. Despite the lack of comparative group, our outcomes, most noticeably hemostatic efficacy and inpatient mortality are consistent with those reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess whether a conservative protocol for oxygen supplementation could improve outcomes in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Oxygen-ICU was a single-center, open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted from March 2010 to October 2012 that included all adults admitted with an expected length of stay of 72 hours or longer to the medical-surgical ICU of Modena University Hospital, Italy. The originally planned sample size was 660 patients, but the study was stopped early due to difficulties in enrollment after inclusion of 480 patients. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive oxygen therapy to maintain PaO2 between 70 and 100 mm Hg or arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) between 94\% and 98\% (conservative group) or, according to standard ICU practice, to allow PaO2 values up to 150 mm Hg or SpO2 values between 97\% and 100\% (conventional control group). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes included occurrence of new organ failure and infection 48 hours or more after ICU admission. RESULTS A total of 434 patients (median age, 64 years; 188 [43.3\%] women) received conventional (n = 218) or conservative (n = 216) oxygen therapy and were included in the modified intent-to-treat analysis. Daily time-weighted PaO2 averages during the ICU stay were significantly higher (P {$<$} .001) in the conventional group (median PaO2, 102 mm Hg [IQR, 88-116]) vs the conservative group (median PaO2, 87 mm Hg [IQR, 79-97]). Mortality was lower in the conservative oxygen therapy group. The conservative group had fewer episodes of shock, liver failure, and bacteremia. Primary outcome ICU mortality Secondary outcomes Shock Liver failure Bacteremia Oxygen Therapy, No. (\%) Conservative Conventional (n = 216) (n = 218) Absolute Risk Reduction (95\% CI) P Value 25 (11.6) 44 (20.2) 0.086 (0.017-0.150) .01 8 (3.7) 23 (10.6) 0.068 (0.020-0.120) .006 4 (1.9) 14 (6.4) 0.046 (0.008-0.088) .02 11 (5.1) 22 (10.1) 0.050 (0.000-0.090) .049 Editorial page 1553 Supplemental content CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among critically ill patients with an ICU length of stay of 72 hours or longer, a conservative protocol for oxygen therapy vs conventional therapy resulted in lower ICU mortality.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In parallel investigator-initiated, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials in Canada (``Spot Sign'' Selection of Intracerebral Hemorrhage to Guide Hemostatic Therapy [SPOTLIGHT]) and the United States (The Spot Sign for Predicting and Treating ICH Growth Study [STOP-IT]) with harmonized protocols and a preplanned individual patient\textendash level pooled analysis, patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute primary spontaneous ICH and a spot sign on CT angiography were recruited. Data were collected from November 2010 to May 2016. Data were analyzed from November 2016 to May 2017. INTERVENTIONS Eligible patients were randomly assigned 80 {$\mu$}g/kg of intravenous rFVIIa or placebo as soon as possible within 6.5 hours of stroke onset. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Head CT at 24 hours assessed parenchymal ICH volume expansion from baseline (primary outcome) and total (ie, parenchymal plus intraventricular) hemorrhage volume expansion (secondary outcome). The pooled analysis compared hemorrhage expansion between groups by analyzing 24-hour volumes in a linear regression model adjusted for baseline volumes, time from stroke onset to treatment, and trial. RESULTS Of the 69 included patients, 35 (51\%) were male, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 70 (59-80) years. Baseline median (IQR) ICH volumes were 16.3 (9.6-39.2) mL in the rFVIIa group and 20.4 (8.6-32.6) mL in the placebo group. Median (IQR) time from CT to treatment was 71 (57-96) minutes, and the median (IQR) time from stroke onset to treatment was 178 (138-197) minutes. The median (IQR) increase in ICH volume from baseline to 24 hours was small in both the rFVIIa group (2.5 [0-10.2] mL) and placebo group (2.6 [0-6.6] mL). After adjustment, there was no difference between groups on measures of ICH or total hemorrhage expansion. At 90 days, 9 of 30 patients in the rFVIIa group and 13 of 34 in the placebo group had died or were severely disabled (P = .60). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with spot sign\textendash positive ICH treated a median of about 3 hours from stroke onset, rFVIIa did not significantly improve radiographic or clinical outcomes.},

We review and comment on the long-used guidelines for interpreting evidence as supporting a causal association and contrast them with the potential outcomes framework that encourages thinking in terms of causes that are interventions. We argue that in public health this framework is more suitable, providing an estimate of an action's consequences rather than the less precise notion of a risk factor's causal effect. A variety of modern statistical methods adopt this approach. When an intervention cannot be specified, causal relations can still exist, but how to intervene to change the outcome will be unclear. In application, the often-complex structure of causal processes needs to be acknowledged and appropriate data collected to study them. These newer approaches need to be brought to bear on the increasingly complex public health challenges of our globalized world.},

  abstract = {Pregnancy is associated with a number of pathophysiological changes (including modification of vascular resistance, increased vascular permeability, and coagulative disorders) that can lead to specific (eclampsia, preeclampsia) or not specific (intracranial hemorrhage) neurological complications. In addition to these disorders, pregnancy can affect numerous preexisting neurologic conditions, including epilepsy, brain tumors, and intracerebral bleeding from cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformations. Intracranial complications related to pregnancy can expose patients to a high risk of intracranial hypertension (IHT). Unfortunately, at present, the therapeutic measures that are generally adopted for the control of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in the general population have not been examined in pregnant patients, and their efficacy and safety for the mother and the fetus is still unknown. In addition, no specific guidelines for the application of the staircase approach, including escalating treatments with increasing intensity of level, for the management of IHT exist for this population. Although some of basic measures can be considered safe even in pregnant patients (management of stable hemodynamic and respiratory function, optimization of systemic physiology), some other interventions, such as hyperventilation, osmotic therapy, hypothermia, barbiturates, and decompressive craniectomy, can lead to specific concerns for the safety of both mother and fetus. The aim of this review is to summarize the neurological pathophysiological changes occurring during pregnancy and explore the effects of the possible therapeutic interventions applied to the general population for the management of IHT during pregnancy, taking into consideration ethical and clinical concerns as well as the decision for the timing of treatment and delivery.},

  abstract = {Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of therapeutic-dose heparin in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 produced conflicting results, possibly due to heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) across individuals. Better understanding of HTE could facilitate individualized clinical decision-making.To evaluate HTE of therapeutic-dose heparin for patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and to compare approaches to assessing HTE.Exploratory analysis of a multiplatform adaptive RCT of therapeutic-dose heparin vs usual care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in 3320 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 enrolled in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia between April 2020 and January 2021. Heterogeneity of treatment effect was assessed 3 ways: using (1) conventional subgroup analyses of baseline characteristics, (2) a multivariable outcome prediction model (risk-based approach), and (3) a multivariable causal forest model (effect-based approach). Analyses primarily used bayesian statistics, consistent with the original trial.Participants were randomized to therapeutic-dose heparin or usual care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis.Organ support\textendash free days, assigning a value of -1 to those who died in the hospital and the number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support up to day 21 for those who survived to hospital discharge; and hospital survival.Baseline demographic characteristics were similar between patients randomized to therapeutic-dose heparin or usual care (median age, 60 years; 38\% female; 32\% known non-White race; 45\% Hispanic). In the overall multiplatform RCT population, therapeutic-dose heparin was not associated with an increase in organ support\textendash free days (median value for the posterior distribution of the OR, 1.05; 95\% credible interval, 0.91-1.22). In conventional subgroup analyses, the effect of therapeutic-dose heparin on organ support\textendash free days differed between patients requiring organ support at baseline or not (median OR, 0.85 vs 1.30; posterior probability of difference in OR, 99.8\%), between females and males (median OR, 0.87 vs 1.16; posterior probability of difference in OR, 96.4\%), and between patients with lower body mass index (BMI \&lt;30) vs higher BMI groups (BMI {$\geq$}30; posterior probability of difference in ORs \&gt;90\% for all comparisons). In risk-based analysis, patients at lowest risk of poor outcome had the highest propensity for benefit from heparin (lowest risk decile: posterior probability of OR \&gt;1, 92\%) while those at highest risk were most likely to be harmed (highest risk decile: posterior probability of OR \&lt;1, 87\%). In effect-based analysis, a subset of patients identified at high risk of harm (P\,=\,.05 for difference in treatment effect) tended to have high BMI and were more likely to require organ support at baseline.Among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, the effect of therapeutic-dose heparin was heterogeneous. In all 3 approaches to assessing HTE, heparin was more likely to be beneficial in those who were less severely ill at presentation or had lower BMI and more likely to be harmful in sicker patients and those with higher BMI. The findings illustrate the importance of considering HTE in the design and analysis of RCTs.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02735707, NCT04505774, NCT04359277, NCT04372589},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have shown a positive benefit-risk balance in both clinical trials and real-world data, but approximately 2\% to 3.5\% of patients experience major bleeding annually. Many of these patients require hospitalization, and the administration of reversal agents may be required to control bleeding. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes associated with the use of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates, idarucizumab, or andexanet for reversal of severe DOAC-associated bleeding. METHODS The investigators systematically searched for studies of reversal agents for the treatment of severe bleeding associated with DOAC. Mortality rates, thromboembolic events, and hemostatic efficacy were meta-analyzed using a random effects model. RESULTS The investigators evaluated 60 studies in 4,735 patients with severe DOAC-related bleeding who were treated with 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2,688), idarucizumab (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1,111), or andexanet (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 936). The mortality rate was 17.7\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 15.1\% to 20.4\%), and it was higher in patients with intracranial bleedings (20.2\%) than in patients with extracranial hemorrhages (15.4\%). The thromboembolism rate was 4.6\% (95\% CI: 3.3\% to 6.0\%), being particularly high with andexanet (10.7\%; 95\% CI: 6.5\% to 15.7\%). The effective hemostasis rate was 78.5\% (95\% CI: 75.1\% to 81.8\%) and was similar regardless of the reversal agent considered. The rebleeding rate was 13.2\% (95\% CI: 5.5\% to 23.1\%) and 78\% of rebleeds occurred after resumption of anticoagulation. The risk of death was markedly and significantly associated with failure to achieve effective hemostasis (relative risk: 3.63; 95\% CI: 2.56 to 5.16). The results were robust regardless of the type of study or the hemostatic scale used. CONCLUSIONS The risk of death after severe DOAC-related bleeding remains significant despite a high rate of effective hemostasis with reversal agents. Failure to achieve effective hemostasis strongly correlated with a fatal outcome. Thromboembolism rates are particularly high with andexanet. Comparative clinical trials are needed.

  abstract = {Prognostication is crucial in the neurological intensive care unit (neuroICU). Patients with severe acute brain injury (SABI) are unable to make their own decisions because of the insult itself or sedation needs. Surrogate decision makers, usually family members, must make decisions on the patient's behalf. However, many are unprepared for their role as surrogates owing to the sudden and unexpected nature of SABI. Surrogates rely on clinicians in the neuroICU to provide them with an outlook (prognosis) with which to make substituted judgments and decide on treatments and goals of care on behalf of the patient. Therefore, how a prognostic estimate is derived, and then communicated, is extremely important. Prognostication in the neuroICU is highly variable between clinicians and institutions, and evidence based guidelines are lacking. Shared decision making (SDM), where surrogates and clinicians arrive together at an individualized decision based on patient values and preferences, has been proposed as an opportunity to improve clinician-family communication and ensure that patients receive treatments they would choose. This review outlines the importance and current challenges of prognostication in the neuroICU and how prognostication and SDM intersect, based on relevant research and expert opinion.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Calculating equipotent doses between vasopressor agents is necessary in clinical practice and research pertaining to the management of shock. This scoping review summarizes conversion ratios between vasopressors and provides a formula to incorporate into study designs. Materials and methods: Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to 21st October 2020. Additional papers were obtained through bibliography searches of retrieved articles. Two investigators assessed articles for eligibility. Clinical trials comparing the potency of at least two intravenous vasopressors (norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, phenylephrine, vasopressin, metaraminol or angiotensin II), with regard to an outcome of blood pressure, were selected. Results: Of 16,315 articles, 21 were included for synthesis. The range of conversion ratios equivalent to one unit of norepinephrine were: epinephrine (0.7-1.4), dopamine (75.2-144.4), metaraminol (8.3), phenylephrine (1.1-16.3), vasopressin (0.3-0.4) and angiotensin II (0.070.13). The following formula may be considered for the calculation of norepinephrine equivalents (NE) (all in mcg/kg/min, except vasopressin in units/min): NE = norepinephrine + epinephrine + phenylephrine/10 + dopamine/100 + metaraminol/8 + vasopressin*2.5 + angiotensin II*10. Conclusion: A summary of equipotent ratios for common vasopressors used in clinical practice has been provided. Our formula may be considered to calculate NE for studies in the intensive care unit.},

Whether the use of remdesivir in symptomatic, nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19 who are at high risk for disease progression prevents hospitalization is uncertain. METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19 who had symptom onset within the previous 7 days and who had at least one risk factor for disease progression (age {$\geq$}60 years, obesity, or certain coexisting medical conditions). Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg on days 2 and 3) or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of Covid-19\textendash related hospitalization or death from any cause by day 28. The primary safety end point was any adverse event. A secondary end point was a composite of a Covid-19\textendash related medically attended visit or death from any cause by day 28. RESULTS A total of 562 patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of remdesivir or placebo were included in the analyses: 279 patients in the remdesivir group and 283 in the placebo group. The mean age was 50 years, 47.9\% of the patients were women, and 41.8\% were Hispanic or Latinx. The most common coexisting conditions were diabetes mellitus (61.6\%), obesity (55.2\%), and hypertension (47.7\%). Covid-19\textendash related hospitalization or death from any cause occurred in 2 patients (0.7\%) in the remdesivir group and in 15 (5.3\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to 0.59; P\,=\,0.008). A total of 4 of 246 patients (1.6\%) in the remdesivir group and 21 of 252 (8.3\%) in the placebo group had a Covid-19\textendash related medically attended visit by day 28 (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95\% CI, 0.07 to 0.56). No patients had died by day 28. Adverse events occurred in 42.3\% of the patients in the remdesivir group and in 46.3\% of those in the placebo group.

Several factors, including patients' characteristics, the presence of hydrocephalus and intraparenchymal hematoma, might also contribute to this effect. The aim of this study was to assess the temporal changes in mortality and neurologic outcome in SAH patients and identify their predictors. Methods: We performed a single center retrospective cohort study from 2004 to 2018. All non-traumatic SAH patients with poor grade on admission (WFNS score of 4 or 5) who remained at least 24 h in the hospital were included. Time course was analyzed into four groups according to the years of admission (2004\textendash 2007; 2008\textendash 2011; 2012\textendash 2015 and 2016\textendash 2018). Results: A total of 353 patients were included in this study: 202 patients died (57 \%) and 260 (74 \%) had unfavorable neurological outcome (UO) at 3 months. Mortality tended to decrease in in 2008\textendash 2011 and 2016\textendash 2018 periods (HR 0.55 [0.34\textendash 0.89] and HR 0.33 [0.20\textendash 0.53], respectively, when compared to 2004\textendash 2007). The proportion of patients with UO remained high and did not vary significantly over time. Patients with WFNS 5 had higher mortality (68 \% vs. 34 \%, p = 0.001) and more frequent UO (83 \% vs. 54 \%, p = 0.001) than those with WFNS 4. In the multivariable analysis, WFNS 5 was independently associated with mortality (HR 2.12 [1.43\textendash 3.14]) and UO (OR 3.23 [1.67\textendash 6.25]). The presence of hydrocephalus was associated with a lower risk of mortality (HR 0.60 [0.43\textendash 0.84]). Conclusions: Both hospital mortality and UO remained high in poor grade SAH patients. Patients with WFNS 5 on admission had worse prognosis than others; this should be taken into consideration for future clinical studies.},

DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: University hospital medical intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Two hundred forty-five patients with predominantly cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic data, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, and Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) were obtained. All adult survivors staying in the intensive care unit for {$>$}24 hrs were eligible. Pre-intensive care unit status was obtained for 245 patients (179 males, mean age 64 yrs, mean intensive care unit stay 3 days, SAPS II 26 +/- 10), and 153 patients completed all three questionnaires. In this cohort, none of the eight health dimensions of the SF-36 showed impaired functioning after 9 months compared with baseline values. Physical and emotional role deteriorated after 1 month but returned to baseline thereafter. Notably, the mental health summary scale did not change during the course of the study, whereas the physical health summary scale consistently improved over time. Patients older than the median of 66 yrs rated their physical functioning lower. No association with SAPS II or SOFA and SF-36 was found. CONCLUSION: Quality of life after intensive care unit is a dynamic process, with some functions improving shortly after intensive care unit discharge and others deteriorating but returning at least to baseline values later on. In this patient population, the SF-36 was independent from measures of severity of illness or morbidity. Health-related quality of life represents a feasible method to collect patients' individual views in contrast to surrogate measures of outcome.},

  abstract = {Background Vitamin K antagonists are highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but have several limitations. Apixaban is a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in a similar population in comparison with aspirin. Methods In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) with warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0) in 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary outcome was ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority, with key secondary objectives of testing for superiority with respect to the primary outcome and to the rates of major bleeding and death from any cause. Results The median duration of follow-up was 1.8 years. The rate of the primary outcome was 1.27\% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 1.60\% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.79; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.95; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority; P\,=\,0.01 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 2.13\% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 3.09\% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 0.80; P{$<$}0.001), and the rates of death from any cause were 3.52\% and 3.94\%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.80 to 0.99; P\,=\,0.047). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.24\% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 0.47\% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95\% CI, 0.35 to 0.75; P{$<$}0.001), and the rate of ischemic or uncertain type of stroke was 0.97\% per year in the apixaban group and 1.05\% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.74 to 1.13; P\,=\,0.42).

Results:\hspace{0.6em} The adjusted mean difference on days alive without life support at day 28 (primary outcome) was 1.3 days (95\% CrI -0.3 to 2.9; 94.2\% probability of benefit). Adjusted relative risks and probabilities of benefit on seri-ous adverse reactions was 0.85 (0.63 to 1.16; 84.1\%) and on mortality 0.87 (0.73 to 1.03; 94.8\%) at day 28 and 0.88 (0.75 to 1.02; 95.1\%) at day 90. Probabilities of benefit on days alive without life support and days alive out of hospital at day 90 were 85 and 95.7\%, respectively. Results were largely consistent across sensitivity analyses, with relatively low probabilities of clinically important harm with 12 mg on all outcomes in all analyses.},

  abstract = {Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for providing unbiased evidence of intervention effects. Here, we provide an overview of the history of RCTs and discuss the major challenges and limitations of current critical care RCTs, including overly optimistic effect sizes; unnuanced conclusions based on dichotomization of results; limited focus on patient-centred outcomes other than mortality; lack of flexibility and ability to adapt, increasing the risk of inconclusive results and limiting knowledge gains before trial completion; and inefficiency due to lack of re-use of trial infrastructure. We discuss recent developments in critical care RCTs and novel methods that may provide solutions to some of these challenges, including a research programme approach (consecutive, complementary studies of multiple types rather than individual, independent studies), and novel design and analysis methods. These include standardization of trial protocols; alternative outcome choices and use of core outcome sets; increased acceptance of uncertainty, probabilistic interpretations and use of Bayesian statistics; novel approaches to assessing heterogeneity of treatment effects; adaptation and platform trials; and increased integration between clinical trials and clinical practice. We outline the advantages and discuss the potential methodological and practical disadvantages with these approaches. With this review, we aim to inform clinicians and researchers about conventional and novel RCTs, including the rationale for choosing one or the other methodological approach based on a thorough discussion of pros and cons. Importantly, the most central feature remains the randomisation, which provides unparalleled restriction of confounding compared to non-randomised designs by reducing confounding to chance.},

  abstract = {Objective The contemporary diagnosis of paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNSs) requires an increasing understanding of their clinical, immunologic, and oncologic heterogeneity. The 2004 PNS criteria are partially outdated due to advances in PNS research in the last 16 years leading to the identification of new phenotypes and antibodies that have transformed the diagnostic approach to PNS. Here, we propose updated diagnostic criteria for PNS. Methods A panel of experts developed by consensus a modified set of diagnostic PNS criteria for clinical decision making and research purposes. The panel reappraised the 2004 criteria alongside new knowledge on PNS obtained from published and unpublished data generated by the different laboratories involved in the project. Results The panel proposed to substitute ``classical syndromes'' with the term ``high-risk phenotypes'' for cancer and introduce the concept of ``intermediate-risk phenotypes.'' The term ``onconeural antibody'' was replaced by ``high risk'' ({$>$}70\% associated with cancer) and ``intermediate risk'' (30\%\textendash 70\% associated with cancer) antibodies. The panel classified 3 levels of evidence for PNS: definite, probable, and possible. Each level can be reached by using the PNS-Care Score, which combines clinical phenotype, antibody type, the presence or absence of cancer, and time of follow-up. With the exception of opsoclonus-myoclonus, the diagnosis of definite PNS requires the presence of high- or intermediate-risk antibodies. Specific recommendations for similar syndromes triggered by immune checkpoint inhibitors are also provided. Conclusions The proposed criteria and recommendations should be used to enhance the clinical care of patients with PNS and to encourage standardization of research initiatives addressing PNS.},

This paper explores some competing mental models of how infectious diseases spread and shows how these models influenced the scientific process and the kinds of facts that were generated, legitimized and used to support policy. A central theme in the paper is the relative weight given by dominant scientific voices to probabilistic arguments based on experimental measurements versus mechanistic arguments based on theory. Two examples are explored: the cholera epidemic in nineteenth century London\textemdash in which the story of John Snow and the Broad Street pump is retold\textemdash and the unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and early 2021\textemdash in which the evidence-based medicine movement and its hierarchy of evidence features prominently. In each case, it is shown that prevailing mental models\textemdash which were assumed by some to transcend theory but were actually heavily theory-laden\textemdash powerfully shaped both science and policy, with fatal consequences for some.},

  abstract = {Statistical science (as opposed to mathematical statistics) involves far more than probability theory, for it requires realistic causal models of data generators \textendash{} even for purely descriptive goals. Statistical decision theory requires more causality: Rational decisions are actions taken to minimize costs while maximizing benefits, and thus require explication of causes of loss and gain. Competent statistical practice thus integrates logic, context, and probability into scientific inference and decision using narratives filled with causality. This reality was seen and accounted for intuitively by the founders of modern statistics, but was not well recognized in the ensuing statistical theory (which focused instead on the causally inert properties of probability measures). Nonetheless, both statistical foundations and basic statistics can and should be taught using formal causal models. The causal view of statistical science fits within a broader information-processing framework which illuminates and unifies frequentist, Bayesian, and related probability-based foundations of statistics. Causality theory can thus be seen as a key component connecting computation to contextual information, not ``extrastatistical'' but instead essential for sound statistical training and applications.

However, null P values still thrive in most journals and are routinely misinterpreted as probabilities of a ``chance finding'' or of the null, when they are no such thing. This misuse may be lessened by recognizing correct Bayesian interpretations. For example, under weak priors, 95\% confidence intervals approximate 95\% posterior probability intervals, one-sided P values approximate directional posterior probabilities, and point estimates approximate posterior medians. Furthermore, under certain conditions, a one-sided P value for a prior median provides an approximate lower bound on the posterior probability that the point estimate is on the wrong side of that median. More generally, P values can be incorporated into a modern analysis framework that emphasizes measurement of fit, distance, and posterior probability in place of ``statistical significance'' and accept/reject decisions.},

Data Sources:~         PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and CENTRAL from inception to September 15, 2018.         Study Selection:~         Adult studies validating the Intracerebral Hemorrhage score for mortality prediction in nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage at 1 month/discharge or sooner.         Data Extraction:~         Data were collected on the following aspects of study design: population studied, level of care, timing of outcome measurement, mean study year, and mean cohort Intracerebral Hemorrhage score. The summary measures of interest were discrimination as assessed by the C-statistic and calibration as assessed by the standardized mortality ratio (observed:expected mortality ratio). Random effect models were used to pool both measures. Heterogeneity was measured using the I2 statistic and explored using subgroup analysis and meta-regression.         Data Synthesis:~         Fifty-five studies provided data on discrimination, and 35 studies provided data on calibration. Overall, the Intracerebral Hemorrhage score discriminated well (pooled C-statistic 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.82\textendash 0.85) but overestimated mortality (pooled observed:expected mortality ratio = 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.78\textendash 0.97), with high heterogeneity for both estimates (I2 80\% and 84\%, respectively). Discrimination was affected by study mean Intracerebral Hemorrhage score ({$\beta$} = \textendash 0.05), and calibration was affected by disease severity, with the score overestimating mortality for patients with an Intracerebral Hemorrhage score greater than 3 (observed:expected mortality ratio = 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.78\textendash 0.91). Mortality rates were reproducible across cohorts for patients with an Intracerebral Hemorrhage score 0\textendash 1 (I2 = 15\%).         Conclusions:~         The Intracerebral Hemorrhage score is a valid clinical prediction rule for short-term mortality in intracerebral hemorrhage patients but discriminated mortality worse in more severe cohorts. It also overestimated mortality in the highest Intracerebral Hemorrhage score patients, with significant inconsistency between cohorts. These results suggest that mortality for these patients is dependent on factors not included in the score. Further studies are needed to determine these factors.},

  abstract = {The role of non-invasive respiratory support (high-flow nasal oxygen and noninvasive ventilation) in the manage-ment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome is debated. The oxygenation improvement coupled with lung and diaphragm protection produced by non-invasive support may help to avoid endotracheal intubation, which prevents the complications of sedation and invasive mechanical ventilation. However, spontaneous breathing in patients with lung injury carries the risk that vigorous inspiratory effort, combined or not with mechanical increases in inspiratory airway pressure, produces high transpulmonary pressure swings and local lung overstretch. This ultimately results in additional lung damage (patient self-inflicted lung injury), so that patients intubated after a trial of noninvasive support are burdened by increased mortality. Reducing inspiratory effort by high-flow nasal oxygen or delivery of sustained positive end-expiratory pressure through the helmet interface may reduce these risks. In this physiology-to-bedside review, we provide an updated overview about the role of nonin-vasive respiratory support strategies as early treatment of hypoxemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit. Noninvasive strategies appear safe and effective in mild-to-moderate hypoxemia \-(PaO2/FiO2\,{$>$}\,150 mmHg), while they can yield delayed intubation with increased mortality in a significant proportion of moderate-to-severe (\-PaO2/ FiO2\,{$\leq$}\,150 mmHg) cases. High-flow nasal oxygen and helmet noninvasive ventilation represent the most promising techniques for first-line treatment of severe patients. However, no conclusive evidence allows to recommend a single approach over the others in case of moderate-to-severe hypoxemia. During any treatment, strict physiological moni-toring remains of paramount importance to promptly detect the need for endotracheal intubation and not delay protective ventilation.},

Studies have used datasets sampled from patients admitted to hospital, people tested for active infection, or people who volunteered to participate. Here, we highlight the challenge of interpreting observational evidence from such non-representative samples. Collider bias can induce associations between two or more variables which affect the likelihood of an individual being sampled, distorting associations between these variables in the sample. Analysing UK Biobank data, compared to the wider cohort the participants tested for COVID-19 were highly selected for a range of genetic, behavioural, cardiovascular, demographic, and anthropometric traits. We discuss the mechanisms inducing these problems, and approaches that could help mitigate them. While collider bias should be explored in existing studies, the optimal way to mitigate the problem is to use appropriate sampling strategies at the study design stage.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Mobile stroke units (MSUs) are ambulances with staff and a computed tomographic scanner that may enable faster treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) than standard management by emergency medical services (EMS). Whether and how much MSUs alter outcomes has not been extensively studied. METHODS In an observational, prospective, multicenter, alternating-week trial, we assessed outcomes from MSU or EMS management within 4.5 hours after onset of acute stroke symptoms. The primary outcome was the score on the utility-weighted modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better outcomes according to a patient value system, derived from scores on the modified Rankin scale of 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating more disability). The main analysis involved dichotomized scores on the utility-weighted modified Rankin scale ({$\geq$}0.91 or {$<$}0.91, approximating scores on the modified Rankin scale of {$\leq$}1 or {$>$}1) at 90 days in patients eligible for t-PA. Analyses were also performed in all enrolled patients. The authors' full names, academic degrees, and affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

CME at NEJM.org RESULTS We enrolled 1515 patients, of whom 1047 were eligible to receive t-PA; 617 received care by MSU and 430 by EMS. The median time from onset of stroke to administration of t-PA was 72 minutes in the MSU group and 108 minutes in the EMS group. Of patients eligible for t-PA, 97.1\% in the MSU group received t-PA, as compared with 79.5\% in the EMS group. The mean score on the utility-weighted modified Rankin scale at 90 days in patients eligible for t-PA was 0.72 in the MSU group and 0.66 in the EMS group (adjusted odds ratio for a score of {$\geq$}0.91, 2.43; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.75 to 3.36; P{$<$}0.001). Among the patients eligible for t-PA, 55.0\% in the MSU group and 44.4\% in the EMS group had a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days. Among all enrolled patients, the mean score on the utility-weighted modified Rankin scale at discharge was 0.57 in the MSU group and 0.51 in the EMS group (adjusted odds ratio for a score of {$\geq$}0.91, 1.82; 95\% CI, 1.39 to 2.37; P{$<$}0.001). Secondary clinical outcomes generally favored MSUs. Mortality at 90 days was 8.9\% in the MSU group and 11.9\% in the EMS group. CONCLUSIONS In patients with acute stroke who were eligible for t-PA, utility-weighted disability outcomes at 90 days were better with MSUs than with EMS.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare comorbidities and use of surgery and palliative care between men and women with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). METHODS: The Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study is a prospective, multicenter, case-control study of ICH risk factors and outcomes. We compared comorbidities, treatments, and use of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders in men vs women. Multivariate analysis was used to assess the likelihood of ICH surgery and palliative care after adjustment for variables that were p {$<$} 0.1 in univariate analyses and backward elimination to retain those that were significant (p {$<$} 0.05). RESULTS: Women were older on average (65.0 vs 59.9, p {$<$} 0.0001), and higher proportions of women had previous stroke (24.1\% vs 19.3\%, p = 0.002), had dementia (6.1\% vs 3.4\%, p = 0.0007), lived alone (23.1\% vs 18.0\%, p = 0.0005), and took anticoagulants (12.8\% vs 10.1\% p = 0.02), compared with men. Men had higher rates of alcohol and cocaine use. After adjusting for age, hematoma volume, and ICH location, there was no difference in rates of surgical treatment by sex (odds ratio [OR] 0.93 for men vs women, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.28, p = 0.67), and there was no difference in DNR/comfort care decisions after adjustment for ICH score, prior stroke, and dementia (OR 0.96, CI 0.77-1.22, p = 0.76). CONCLUSIONS: After ICH, women do not receive less aggressive care than men after controlling for the substantial comorbidity differences. Future studies on sex bias should include the presence of comorbidities, prestroke disability, and other factors that may influence management.},

  abstract = {The present review of fluid therapy studies using balanced solutions versus isotonic saline fluids (both crystalloids and colloids) aims to address recent controversy in this topic. The change to the acid-base equilibrium based on fluid selection is described. Key terms such as dilutional-hyperchloraemic acidosis (correctly used instead of dilutional acidosis or hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis to account for both the Henderson-Hasselbalch and Stewart equations), isotonic saline and balanced solutions are defined. The review concludes that dilutional-hyperchloraemic acidosis is a side effect, mainly observed after the administration of large volumes of isotonic saline as a crystalloid. Its effect is moderate and relatively transient, and is minimised by limiting crystalloid administration through the use of colloids (in any carrier). Convincing evidence for clinically relevant adverse effects of dilutional-hyperchloraemic acidosis on renal function, coagulation, blood loss, the need for transfusion, gastrointestinal function or mortality cannot be found. In view of the long-term use of isotonic saline either as a crystalloid or as a colloid carrier, the paucity of data documenting detrimental effects of dilutional-hyperchloraemic acidosis and the limited published information on the effects of balanced solutions on outcome, we cannot currently recommend changing fluid therapy to the use of a balanced colloid preparation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The efficacy and safety of tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, in patients who are hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia are unclear. METHODS We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, hospitalized adults with Covid-19 pneumonia to receive either tofacitinib at a dose of 10 mg or placebo twice daily for up to 14 days or until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was the occurrence of death or respiratory failure through day 28 as assessed with the use of an eightlevel ordinal scale (with scores ranging from 1 to 8 and higher scores indicating a worse condition). All-cause mortality and safety were also assessed. RESULTS A total of 289 patients underwent randomization at 15 sites in Brazil. Overall, 89.3\% of the patients received glucocorticoids during hospitalization. The cumulative incidence of death or respiratory failure through day 28 was 18.1\% in the tofacitinib group and 29.0\% in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.63; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.97; P\,=\,0.04). Death from any cause through day 28 occurred in 2.8\% of the patients in the tofacitinib group and in 5.5\% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.15 to 1.63). The proportional odds of having a worse score on the eight-level ordinal scale with tofacitinib, as compared with placebo, was 0.60 (95\% CI, 0.36 to 1.00) at day 14 and 0.54 (95\% CI, 0.27 to 1.06) at day 28. Serious adverse events occurred in 20 patients (14.1\%) in the tofacitinib group and in 17 (12.0\%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS Among patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia, tofacitinib led to a lower risk of death or respiratory failure through day 28 than placebo.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prognosis in acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is related to hematoma volume, where {$>$}30 mL is commonly used to define large ICH as a threshold for neurosurgical decompression but without clear supporting evidence. OBJECTIVES: To determine the factors associated with large ICH and neurosurgical intervention among participants of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trials (INTERACT). METHODS: We performed pooled analysis of the pilot INTERACT1 (n = 404) and main INTERACT2 (n = 2839) studies of ICH patients ({$<$}6 h of onset) with elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP, 150-220 mm Hg) who were randomized to intensive (target SBP {$<$} 140 mm Hg) or contemporaneous guideline-recommended (target SBP {$<$} 180 mm Hg) management. Neurosurgical intervention data were collected at 7 d postrandomization. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine associations. RESULTS: There were 372 (13\%) patients with large ICH volume ({$>$}30 mL), which was associated with nonresiding in China, nondiabetic status, severe neurological deficit (National Institutes of Health stroke scale [NIHSS] score {$\geq$} 15), lobar location, intraventricular hemorrhage extension, raised leucocyte count, and hyponatremia. Significant predictors of those patients who underwent surgery (226 of 3233 patients overall; 83 of 372 patients with large ICH) were younger age, severe neurological deficit (lower Glasgow coma scale score, and NIHSS score {$\geq$} 15), baseline ICH volume {$>$} 30 mL, and intraventricular hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of severe ICH, based on age and clinical and imaging parameters, may facilitate neurosurgery and intensive monitoring of patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To test whether tocilizumab decreases mortality in this population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The data for this study were derived from a multicenter cohort study of 4485 adults with COVID-19 admitted to participating intensive care units (ICUs) at 68 hospitals across the US from March 4 to May 10, 2020. Critically ill adults with COVID-19 were categorized according to whether they received or did not receive tocilizumab in the first 2 days of admission to the ICU. Data were collected retrospectively until June 12, 2020. A Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for confounding. EXPOSURES Treatment with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Time to death, compared via hazard ratios (HRs), and 30-day mortality, compared via risk differences. RESULTS Among the 3924 patients included in the analysis (2464 male [62.8\%]; median age, 62 [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 52-71] years), 433 (11.0\%) received tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission. Patients treated with tocilizumab were younger (median age, 58 [IQR, 48-65] vs 63 [IQR, 52-72] years) and had a higher prevalence of hypoxemia on ICU admission (205 of 433 [47.3\%] vs 1322 of 3491 [37.9\%] with mechanical ventilation and a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen of {$<$}200 mm Hg) than patients not treated with tocilizumab. After applying inverse probability weighting, baseline and severity-of-illness characteristics were well balanced between groups. A total of 1544 patients (39.3\%) died, including 125 (28.9\%) treated with tocilizumab and 1419 (40.6\%) not treated with tocilizumab. In the primary analysis, during a median follow-up of 27 (IQR, 14-37) days, patients treated with tocilizumab had a lower risk of death compared with those not treated with tocilizumab (HR, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.56-0.92). The estimated 30-day mortality was 27.5\% (95\% CI, 21.2\%-33.8\%) in the tocilizumab-treated patients and 37.1\% (95\% CI, 35.5\%-38.7\%) in the non-tocilizumab\textendash treated patients (risk difference, 9.6\%; 95\% CI, 3.1\%-16.0\%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this cohort study, the risk of in-hospital mortality in this study was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab in the first 2 days of ICU admission compared with patients whose treatment did not include early use of tocilizumab. However, the findings may be susceptible to unmeasured confounding, and further research from randomized clinical trials is needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) disproportionately results in hospitalization or death in older patients and those with underlying conditions. Sotrovimab is a pan-sarbecovirus monoclonal antibody that was designed to prevent progression of Covid-19 in high-risk patients early in the course of disease. METHODS In this ongoing, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic Covid-19 ({$\leq$}5 days after the onset of symptoms) and at least one risk factor for disease progression to receive a single infusion of sotrovimab at a dose of 500 mg or placebo. The primary efficacy outcome was hospitalization (for {$>$}24 hours) for any cause or death within 29 days after randomization. RESULTS In this prespecified interim analysis, which included an intention-to-treat population of 583 patients (291 in the sotrovimab group and 292 in the placebo group), 3 patients (1\%) in the sotrovimab group, as compared with 21 patients (7\%) in the placebo group, had disease progression leading to hospitalization or death (relative risk reduction, 85\%; 97.24\% confidence interval, 44 to 96; P\,=\,0.002). In the placebo group, 5 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, including 1 who died by day 29. Safety was assessed in 868 patients (430 in the sotrovimab group and 438 in the placebo group). Adverse events were reported by 17\% of the patients in the sotrovimab group and 19\% of those in the placebo group; serious adverse events were less common with sotrovimab than with placebo (in 2\% and 6\% of the patients, respectively).

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Early neurorehabilitation improves outcomes in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) after brain injury, but its applicability in COVID-19 is unknown. We describe our experience implementing an early neurorehabilitation protocol for patients with COVID-19-associated DoC in the intensive care unit (ICU) and evaluate factors associated with recovery. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} During the initial COVID-19 surge in New York City between March 10 and May 20, 2020, faced with a disproportionately high number of ICU patients with prolonged unresponsiveness, we developed and implemented an early neurorehabilitation protocol, applying standard practices from brain injury rehabilitation care to the ICU setting. Twenty-one patients with delayed recovery of consciousness after severe COVID-19 participated in a pilot early neurorehabilitation program that included serial Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) assessments, multimodal treatment, and access to clinicians specializing in brain injury medicine. We retrospectively compared clinical features of patients who did and did not recover to the minimally conscious state (MCS) or better, defined as a CRS-R total score (TS)\,{$\geq$}\,8, before discharge. We additionally examined factors associated with best CRS-R TS, last CRS-R TS, hospital length of stay, and time on mechanical ventilation. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Patients underwent CRS-R assessments a median of six (interquartile range [IQR] 3\textendash 10) times before discharge, beginning a median of 48 days (IQR 40\textendash 55) from admission. Twelve (57\%) patients recovered to MCS after a median of 8 days (IQR 2\textendash 14) off continuous sedation; they had lower body mass index (p\,=\,0.009), lower peak serum C-reactive protein levels (p\,=\,0.023), higher minimum arterial partial pressure of oxygen (p\,=\,0.028), and earlier fentanyl discontinuation (p\,=\,0.018). CRS-R scores fluctuated over time, and the best CRS-R TS was significantly higher than the last CRS-R TS (median 8 [IQR 5\textendash 23] vs. 5 [IQR 3\textendash 18], p\,=\,0.002). Earlier fentanyl (p\,=\,0.001) and neuromuscular blockade (p\,=\,0.015) discontinuation correlated with a higher last CRS-R TS. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} More than half of our cohort of patients with prolonged unresponsiveness following severe COVID19 recovered to MCS or better before hospital discharge, achieving a clinical benchmark known to have relatively favorable long-term prognostic implications in DoC of other etiologies.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association of severe traumatic injury with subsequent employment and earnings in long-term survivors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a retrospective, matched, national, population-based cohort study of adults who had employment and were hospitalized with severe traumatic injury in Canada between January 2008 and December 2010. All acute care hospitalizations for severe injury were included if they involved adults aged 30 to 61 years who were hospitalized with severe traumatic injury, working in the 2 years prior to injury, and alive through the third calendar year after their injury. Patients were matched with unexposed control participants based on age, sex, marital status, province of residence, rurality, baseline health characteristics, baseline earnings, self-employment status, union membership, and year of the index event. Data analysis occurred from March 2019 to December 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in employment status and annual earnings, compared with unexposed control participants, were evaluated in the third calendar year after injury. Weighted multivariable probit regression was used to compare proportions of individuals working between those who survived trauma and control participants. The association of injury with mean yearly earnings was quantified using matched difference-in-difference, ordinary least-squares regression. RESULTS A total of 5167 adults (25.6\% female; mean [SD] age, 47.3 [8.8] years) with severe injuries were matched with control participants who were unexposed (25.6\% female; mean [SD] age, 47.3 [8.8] years). Three years after trauma, 79.3\% of those who survived trauma were working, compared with 91.7\% of control participants, a difference of -12.4 (95\% CI, -13.5 to -11.4) percentage points. Three years after injury, patients with injuries experienced a mean loss of \$9745 (95\% CI, -\$10 739 to -\$8752) in earnings compared with control participants, representing a 19.0\% difference in annual earnings. Those who remained employed 3 years after injury experienced a 10.8\% loss of earnings compared with control participants (-\$6043 [95\% CI, -\$7101 to -\$4986]). Loss of work was proportionately higher in those with lower preinjury income (lowest tercile, -18.5\% [95\% CI, -20.8\% to -16.2\%]; middle tercile, -11.5\% [95\% CI, -13.2\% to -9.9\%]; highest tercile, -6.0\% (95\% CI, -7.8\% to -4.3\%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, severe traumatic injury had a significant association with employment and earnings of adults of working age. Those with lower preinjury earnings experienced the greatest relative loss of employment and earnings.},

We searched for and screened 1,170 articles from 18 high-profile journals (65 per journal) published from 2010\textendash 2019. Based on written framing and systematic guidance, 3 reviewers rated the degree of causality implied in abstracts and full text for exposure/outcome linking language and action recommendations. Reviewers rated the causal implication of exposure/outcome linking language as none (no causal implication) in 13.8\%, weak in 34.2\%, moderate in 33.2\%, and strong in 18.7\% of abstracts. The implied causality of action recommendations was higher than the implied causality of linking sentences for 44.5\% or commensurate for 40.3\% of articles. The most common linking word in abstracts was ``associate'' (45.7\%). Reviewers' ratings of linking word roots were highly heterogeneous; over half of reviewers rated ``association'' as having at least some causal implication. This research undercuts the assumption that avoiding ``causal'' words leads to clarity of interpretation in medical research.},

We are often faced with the difficult decision between having weak trials or not having a trial at all. In a recent article, Dr. Atle Fretheim argues that statistically underpowered studies are still valuable, particularly in conjunction with other similar studies in meta-analysis in the context of the DANMASK-19 trial, asking "Surely, some trial evidence must be better than no trial evidence?" However, informative trials are not always feasible, and feasible trials are not always informative. In some cases, even a well-conducted but weakly designed and/or underpowered trial such as DANMASK-19 may be uninformative or worse, both individually and in a body of literature. Meta-analysis, for example, can only resolve issues of statistical power if there is a reasonable expectation of compatible well-designed trials. Uninformative designs may also invite misinformation. Here, we make the case that-when considering informativeness, ethics, and opportunity costs in addition to statistical power-"nothing" is often the better choice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Accurate estimates for risk and rates of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in the natural course of patients harboring brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM) are needed to provide a quantitative basis for planning clinical trials to evaluate interventional strategies and to help guide practice management. METHODS: We identified patients with BAVM at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health maintenance organization and documented their clinical course. The influences of age at diagnosis, gender, race-ethnicity, ICH at presentation, venous draining pattern, and BAVM size on ICH subsequent to presentation were studied using the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: We identified 790 patients with BAVM (51\% female; 63\% white; mean age+/-SD at diagnosis: 38+/-19 years) between 1961 and 2001. Patients who presented with ICH experienced a higher rate of subsequent ICH than those who presented without ICH under multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 11.9; P{$<$}0.032). The effect was similar across race-ethnicity and gender. This difference in ICH rates was greatest in the first year (7\% versus 3\% per year) and converged over time. The effect of subsequent ICH on functional status was similar to that of the initial ICH. CONCLUSIONS: Presentation with ICH was the most important predictor of future ICH, confirming previous studies. Future ICH had similar impact on functional outcome as incident ICH. Intervention to prevent ICH would be of potentially greater benefit to patients presenting with ICH, although the advantage decreases over time.},

Therefore, it seems essential that the fluid therapy and plasma volume support of the critically ill patient is in accordance with evidence-based, generally accepted recommendations. However, a debate on the optimal fluid regimens for critically ill patients has been going on for decades and is still as intense as ever before. Not only have the old crystalloid versus colloid discussions been reactivated [1\textendash 5] but also the choice of colloid, the use of albumin in particular, is a matter of considerable controversy [6\textendash 11]. The ongoing debate is somewhat confusing and there are presently no generally accepted intensive care unit (ICU) strategies or guidelines for fluid therapy of critically ill patients.},

  abstract = {Theory suggests advertising should be remarkably sensitive to profit margins. Firms advertise to stimulate demand for their products. They advertise high-margin products aggressively and low-margin ones hardly at all. In modern macroeconomics, wedges are potent sources of fluctuations in employment. The profit margin or markup ratio is a leading example. In an important class of fluctuations models, profit margins rise in recessions and mediate the decline in employment. But a rise in profit margins should expand advertising by a lot. Really a lot. Advertising should be highly countercyclical. Instead, it is somewhat procyclical. The ratio of advertising spending to private GDP falls when the economy contracts. The behavior of advertising refutes the hypothesis that profit margins rise. But it is true that the labor share of income falls. Hence there must be another factor that lowers the labor share without raising profit margins. An influence that fits some of the facts is a rise in a product-market friction or wedge that has the same effect as an increase in sales taxes. The cyclical behavior of advertising should point macroeconomics in a somewhat different direction in explaining employment fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Background: The optimal resuscitative fluid remains controversial. Objective: To assess the association between crystalloid fluid and outcomes in critically ill adults. Methods: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials were searched from inception through July 2019. Cohort studies and randomized trials of critically ill adults provided predominantly nonperioperative fluid resuscitation with balanced crystalloids or 0.9\% sodium chloride (saline) were included. Results: Thirteen studies (n = 30 950) were included. Balanced crystalloids demonstrated lower hospital or 28-/30-day mortality (risk ratio [RR] = 0.86; 95\% CI = 0.750.99; I2 = 82\%) overall, in observational studies (RR = 0.64; 95\% CI = 0.41-0.99; I2 = 63\%), and approached significance in randomized trials (RR = 0.94; 95\% CI = 0.88-1.02; I2 = 0\%). New acute kidney injury occurred less frequently with balanced crystalloids (RR = 0.91; 95\% CI = 0.85-0.98; I2 = 0\%), though progression to renal replacement therapy was similar (RR = 0.91; 95\% CI = 0.79-1.04; I2 = 38\%). In the sepsis cohort, odds of hospital or 28-/30-day mortality were similar, but the odds of major adverse kidney events occurring in the first 30 days were less with balanced crystalloids than saline (OR = 0.78; 95\% CI = 0.66-0.91; I2 = 42\%). Conclusion and Relevance: Resuscitation with balanced crystalloids demonstrated lower hospital or 28-/30-day mortality compared with saline in critically ill adults but not specifically those with sepsis. Balanced crystalloids should be provided preferentially to saline in most critically ill adult patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The comparative efficacy and safety of balanced crystalloid solutions and saline for fluid therapy in critically ill adults remain uncertain. METHODS We systematically reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the use of balanced crystalloids with saline in critically ill adults. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality after pooling data from low-risk-of-bias trials using a random-effects model. We also performed a Bayesian meta-analysis to describe the primary treatment effect in probability terms. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), new treatment with renal replacement therapy (RRT), and ventilator-free and vasopressor-free days to day 28. RESULTS We identified 13 RCTs, comprising 35,884 participants. From six trials (34,450 participants) with a low risk of bias, the risk ratio (RR) for 90-day mortality with balanced crystalloids versus saline was 0.96 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.01; I2 5 12.1\%); using vague priors, the posterior probability that balanced crystalloids reduce mortality was 89.5\%. The RRs of developing AKI and of being treated with RRT with balanced crystalloids versus saline were 0.96 (95\% CI, 0.89 to 1.02) and 0.95 (95\% CI, 0.81 to 1.11), respectively. Ventilator-free days (mean difference, 0.18 days; 95\% CI, 20.45 to 0.81) and vasopressor-free days (mean difference, 0.19 days; 95\% CI, 20.14 to 0.51) were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS The estimated effect of using balanced crystalloids versus saline in critically ill adults ranges from a 9\% relative reduction to a 1\% relative increase in the risk of death, with a high probability that the average effect of using balanced crystalloids is to reduce mortality.

METHODS We conducted a phase 2\textendash 3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in which symptomatic, unvaccinated, nonhospitalized adults at high risk for progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 300 mg of nirmatrelvir plus 100 mg of ritonavir (a pharmacokinetic enhancer) or placebo every 12 hours for 5 days. Covid-19\textendash related hospitalization or death from any cause through day 28, viral load, and safety were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 2246 patients underwent randomization; 1120 patients received nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (nirmatrelvir group) and 1126 received placebo (placebo group). In the planned interim analysis of patients treated within 3 days after symptom onset (modified intention-to treat population, comprising 774 of the 1361 patients in the full analysis population), the incidence of Covid-19\textendash related hospitalization or death by day 28 was lower in the nirmatrelvir group than in the placebo group by 6.32 percentage points (95\% confidence interval [CI], -9.04 to -3.59; P{$<$}0.001; relative risk reduction, 89.1\%); the incidence was 0.77\% (3 of 389 patients) in the nirmatrelvir group, with 0 deaths, as compared with 7.01\% (27 of 385 patients) in the placebo group, with 7 deaths. Efficacy was maintained in the final analysis involving the 1379 patients in the modified intention-to-treat population, with a difference of -5.81 percentage points (95\% CI, -7.78 to -3.84; P{$<$}0.001; relative risk reduction, 88.9\%). All 13 deaths occurred in the placebo group. The viral load was lower with nirmaltrelvir plus ritonavir than with placebo at day 5 of treatment, with an adjusted mean difference of -0.868 log10 copies per milliliter when treatment was initiated within 3 days after the onset of symptoms. The incidence of adverse events that emerged during the treatment period was similar in the two groups (any adverse event, 22.6\% with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir vs. 23.9\% with placebo; serious adverse events, 1.6\% vs. 6.6\%; and adverse events leading to discontinuation of the drugs or placebo, 2.1\% vs. 4.2\%).

  abstract = {Background In 2007, the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation\textemdash Translation of Research Into Practice Study (SAFE-TRIPS) reported that 0.9\% sodium chloride (saline) and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) were the most commonly used resuscitation fluids in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Evidence has emerged since 2007 that these fluids are associated with adverse patient-centred outcomes. Based on the published evidence since 2007, we sought to determine the current type of fluid resuscitation used in clinical practice and the predictors of fluid choice and determine whether these have changed between 2007 and 2014. Methods In 2014, an international, cross-sectional study was conducted (Fluid-TRIPS) to document current patterns of intravenous resuscitation fluid use and determine factors associated with fluid choice. We examined univariate and multivariate associations between patients and prescriber characteristics, geographical region and fluid type. Additionally, we report secular trends of resuscitation fluid use in a cohort of ICUs that participated in both the 2007 and 2014 studies. Regression analysis were conducted to determine changes in the administration of crystalloid or colloid between 2007 and 2014. Findings In 2014, a total of 426 ICUs in 27 countries participated. Over the 24 hour study day, 1456/6707 (21.7\%) patients received resuscitation fluid during 2716 resuscitation episodes. Crystalloids were administered to 1227/1456 (84.3\%) patients during 2208/2716 (81.3\%) episodes and colloids to 394/1456 (27.1\%) patients during 581/2716 (21.4\%) episodes. In multivariate analyses, practice significantly varied between geographical regions. Additionally, patients with a traumatic brain injury were less likely to receive colloid when compared to patients with no trauma (adjusted OR 0.24; 95\% CI 0.1 to 0.62; p = 0.003). Patients in the ICU for one or more days where more likely to receive colloid compared to patients in the ICU on their admission date (adjusted OR 1.75; 95\% CI 1.27 to 2.41; p = {$<$}0.001). For secular trends in fluid resuscitation, 84 ICUs in 17 countries contributed data. In 2007, 527/1663 (31.7\%) patients received fluid resuscitation during 1167 episodes compared to 491/1763 (27.9\%) patients during 960 episodes in 2014. The use of crystalloids increased from 498/1167 (42.7\%) in 2007 to 694/960 (72.3\%) in 2014 (odds ratio (OR) 3.75, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.95 to 4.77; p = {$<$}0.001), primarily due to a significant increase in the use of buffered salt solutions. The use of colloids decreased from 724/1167 (62.0\%) in 2007 to 297/960 (30.9\%) in 2014 (OR 0.29, 95\% CI 0.19 to 0.43; p = {$<$}0.001), primarily due to a decrease in the use of HES, but an overall increase in the use of albumin. Conclusions Clinical practices of intravenous fluid resuscitation have changed between 2007 and 2014. Geographical location remains a strong predictor of the type of fluid administered for fluid resuscitation. Overall, there is a preferential use of crystalloids, specifically buffered salt solutions, over colloids. There is now an imperative to conduct a trial determining the safety and efficacy of these fluids on patient-centred outcomes.

The reference lists of identified studies were hand-searched for further relevant studies. Inclusion criteria were studies of any design evaluating communication of prognostic information that included adult patients with an advanced, life-limiting illness; their caregivers; and qualified HPs. Results showed that although the majority of HPs believed that patients and caregivers should be told the truth about the prognosis, in practice, many either avoid discussing the topic or withhold information. Reasons include perceived lack of training, stress, no time to attend to the patient's emotional needs, fear of a negative impact on the patient, uncertainty about prognostication, requests from family members to withhold information and a feeling of inadequacy or hopelessness regarding the unavailability of further curative treatment. Studies suggest that patients can discuss the topic without it having a negative impact on them. Differences and similarities in findings from different cultures are explored.

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models are developed to calculate estimates of the probability of the presence/occurrence or future course of a particular prognostic or diagnostic outcome from multiple clinical or non-clinical parameters. Radiologic imaging techniques are being developed for accurate detection and early diagnosis of disease, which will eventually affect patient outcomes. Hence, results obtained by radiological means, especially diagnostic imaging, are frequently incorporated into a clinical prediction model as important predictive parameters, and the performance of the prediction model may improve in both diagnostic and prognostic settings. This article explains in a conceptual manner the overall process of developing and validating a clinical prediction model involving radiological parameters in relation to the study design and statistical methods. Collection of a raw dataset; selection of an appropriate statistical model; predictor selection; evaluation of model performance using a calibration plot, Hosmer-Lemeshow test and c-index; internal and external validation; comparison of different models using c-index, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination improvement; and a method to create an easy-to-use prediction score system will be addressed. This article may serve as a practical methodological reference for clinical researchers.}

  abstract = {Status epilepticus is a condition resulting either from the failure of the mechanisms responsible for seizure termination or from the initiation of mechanisms that lead to abnormally prolonged seizures and require urgent administration of antiepileptic drugs. Refractory status epilepticus requires anesthetics drugs and may lead to brain injury with molecular and cellular alterations (eg, inflammation, and neuronal and astroglial injury) that could induce neurologic sequels and further development of epilepsy. Outcome scores based on demographic, clinical, and electroencephalography (EEG) condition are available, allowing prediction of the risk of mortality, but the severity of brain injury in survivors is poorly evaluated. New biomarkers are needed to predict with higher accuracy the outcome of patients admitted with status in an intensive care unit. Here, we summarize the findings of studies from patients and animal models of status epilepticus. Specific protein markers can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and the blood. One of the first described markers of neuronal death is the neuron-specific enolase. Gliosis resulting from inflammatory responses after status can be detected through the increase of S100-beta, or some cytokines, like the High Mobility Group Box 1. Other proteins, like progranulin may reflect the neuroprotective mechanisms resulting from the brain adaptation to excitotoxicity. These new biomarkers aim to prospectively identify the severity and development of disability, and subsequent epilepsy of patients with status. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each biomarker, by evaluating their brain specificity, stability in the fluids, and sensitivity to external interferences, such as hemolysis. Finally, we emphasize the need for further development and validation of such biomarkers in order to better assess patients with severe status epilepticus.},

  abstract = {Background Acute stroke due to supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Open craniotomy haematoma evacuation has not been found to have any benefit in large randomised trials. We assessed whether minimally invasive catheter evacuation followed by thrombolysis (MISTIE), with the aim of decreasing clot size to 15 mL or less, would improve functional outcome in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage. Methods MISTIE III was an open-label, blinded endpoint, phase 3 trial done at 78 hospitals in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and Asia. We enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with spontaneous, non-traumatic, supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage of 30 mL or more. We used a computer-generated number sequence with a block size of four or six to centrally randomise patients to image-guided MISTIE treatment (1{$\cdot$}0 mg alteplase every 8 h for up to nine doses) or standard medical care. Primary outcome was good functional outcome, defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0\textendash 3 at 365 days, adjusted for group differences in prespecified baseline covariates (stability intracerebral haemorrhage size, age, Glasgow Coma Scale, stability intraventricular haemorrhage size, and clot location). Analysis of the primary efficacy outcome was done in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all eligible, randomly assigned patients who were exposed to treatment. All randomly assigned patients were included in the safety analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01827046. Findings Between Dec 30, 2013, and Aug 15, 2017, 506 patients were randomly allocated: 255 (50\%) to the MISTIE group and 251 (50\%) to standard medical care. 499 patients (n=250 in the MISTIE group; n=249 in the standard medical care group) received treatment and were included in the mITT analysis set. The mITT primary adjusted efficacy analysis estimated that 45\% of patients in the MISTIE group and 41\% patients in the standard medical care group had achieved an mRS score of 0\textendash 3 at 365 days (adjusted risk difference 4\% [95\% CI -4 to 12]; p=0{$\cdot$}33). Sensitivity analyses of 365-day mRS using generalised ordered logistic regression models adjusted for baseline variables showed that the estimated odds ratios comparing MISTIE with standard medical care for mRS scores higher than 5 versus 5 or less, higher than 4 versus 4 or less, higher than 3 versus 3 or less, and higher than 2 versus 2 or less were 0{$\cdot$}60 (p=0{$\cdot$}03), 0{$\cdot$}84 (p=0{$\cdot$}42), 0{$\cdot$}87 (p=0{$\cdot$}49), and 0{$\cdot$}82 (p=0{$\cdot$}44), respectively. At 7 days, two (1\%) of 255 patients in the MISTIE group and ten (4\%) of 251 patients in the standard medical care group had died (p=0{$\cdot$}02) and at 30 days, 24 (9\%) patients in the MISTIE group and 37 (15\%) patients in the standard medical care group had died (p=0{$\cdot$}07). The number of patients with symptomatic bleeding and brain bacterial infections was similar between the MISTIE and standard medical care groups (six [2\%] of 255 patients vs three [1\%] of 251 patients; p=0{$\cdot$}33 for symptomatic bleeding; two [1\%] of 255 patients vs 0 [0\%] of 251 patients; p=0{$\cdot$}16 for brain bacterial infections). At 30 days, 76 (30\%) of 255 patients in the MISTIE group and 84 (33\%) of 251 patients in the standard medical care group had one or more serious adverse event, and the difference in number of serious adverse events between the groups was statistically significant (p=0{$\cdot$}012). Interpretation For moderate to large intracerebral haemorrhage, MISTIE did not improve the proportion of patients who achieved a good response 365 days after intracerebral haemorrhage. The procedure was safely adopted by our sample of surgeons. Funding National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Genentech.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intraventricular haemorrhage is a subtype of intracerebral haemorrhage, with 50\% mortality and serious disability for survivors. We aimed to test whether attempting to remove intraventricular haemorrhage with alteplase versus saline irrigation improved functional outcome. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multiregional trial (CLEAR III), participants with a routinely placed extraventricular drain, in the intensive care unit with stable, non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage volume less than 30 mL, intraventricular haemorrhage obstructing the 3rd or 4th ventricles, and no underlying pathology were adaptively randomly assigned (1:1), via a web-based system to receive up to 12 doses, 8 h apart of 1 mg of alteplase or 0{$\cdot$}9\% saline via the extraventricular drain. The treating physician, clinical research staff, and participants were masked to treatment assignment. CT scans were obtained every 24 h throughout dosing. The primary efficacy outcome was good functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 3 or less at 180 days per central adjudication by blinded evaluators. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00784134. FINDINGS: Between Sept 18, 2009, and Jan 13, 2015, 500 patients were randomised: 249 to the alteplase group and 251 to the saline group. 180-day follow-up data were available for analysis from 246 of 249 participants in the alteplase group and 245 of 251 participants in the placebo group. The primary efficacy outcome was similar in each group (good outcome in alteplase group 48\% vs saline 45\%; risk ratio [RR] 1{$\cdot$}06 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}88-1{$\cdot$}28; p=0{$\cdot$}554]). A difference of 3{$\cdot$}5\% (RR 1{$\cdot$}08 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}90-1{$\cdot$}29], p=0{$\cdot$}420) was found after adjustment for intraventricular haemorrhage size and thalamic intracerebral haemorrhage. At 180 days, the treatment group had lower case fatality (46 [18\%] vs saline 73 [29\%], hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}60 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}41-0{$\cdot$}86], p=0{$\cdot$}006), but a greater proportion with mRS 5 (42 [17\%] vs 21 [9\%]; RR 1{$\cdot$}99 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}22-3{$\cdot$}26], p=0{$\cdot$}007). Ventriculitis (17 [7\%] alteplase vs 31 [12\%] saline; RR 0{$\cdot$}55 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}31-0{$\cdot$}97], p=0{$\cdot$}048) and serious adverse events (114 [46\%] alteplase vs 151 [60\%] saline; RR 0{$\cdot$}76 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}64-0{$\cdot$}90], p=0{$\cdot$}002) were less frequent with alteplase treatment. Symptomatic bleeding (six [2\%] in the alteplase group vs five [2\%] in the saline group; RR 1{$\cdot$}21 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}37-3{$\cdot$}91], p=0{$\cdot$}771) was similar. INTERPRETATION: In patients with intraventricular haemorrhage and a routine extraventricular drain, irrigation with alteplase did not substantially improve functional outcomes at the mRS 3 cutoff compared with irrigation with saline. Protocol-based use of alteplase with extraventricular drain seems safe. Future investigation is needed to determine whether a greater frequency of complete intraventricular haemorrhage removal via alteplase produces gains in functional status.

We therefore examined these issues in a population based cohort of 1 year ICH survivors. ICH patients in a defined Swedish population (1.14 million inhabitants) were prospectively registered during 1996. Patients surviving 1 year after ICH onset were followed-up regarding survival status and cause of death until December 2009 using data from the National Census Office and the National Cause of Death Register. Patient prognosis was also compared with the general population using official Swedish mortality data. Clinical and radiological prognostic factors were evaluated. Of 323 patients with ICH, 172 (53\%) survived after 1 year, 127 (39\%) after 5 years and 57 (18\%) after 13 years. Mortality of the 172, 1 year survivors (mean age 67.7 years at ICH) persistently exceeded expected mortality; 13 years post ictus survival was only 34\% compared with 61\% in the general population. Of 115 deaths among the 172, 1 year survivors, 36\% were from cerebrovascular disease and 19\% from ischaemic heart disease. Independent risk factors for death among 1 year survivors were age (HR 1.08 per year; 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.10; p{$<$}0.001), diabetes mellitus at baseline (HR 2.10; 95\% CI 1.18 to 3.74; p=0.012) and anticoagulant therapy (HR 1.99; 95\% CI 1.12 to 3.53; p=0.018) at ICH onset.

Bayesian analysis quantitatively incorporates prior knowledge, but is not often used in applied policy analysis.         Methods:~         We combined 2000\textendash 2016 data from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System with priors based on past empirical studies and policy documents to study the impact of mandatory seat belt laws on traffic fatalities. We used a Bayesian data augmentation approach to combine information from prior studies with difference-in-differences analyses of recent law changes to provide updated evidence on the impact that upgrading to primary enforcement of seat belt laws has on fatalities.         Results:~         After incorporating the evidence from past studies, we find limited evidence to support the hypothesis that recent policy upgrades affect fatality rates. We estimate that upgrading to primary enforcement reduced fatality rates by 0.37 deaths per billion vehicle miles traveled (95\% posterior interval -0.90, 0.16), or a rate ratio of 0.96 (95\% posterior interval 0.91, 1.02), and increased the proportion of decedents reported as wearing seat belts by 7 percentage points (95\% posterior interval 5, 8), or a risk ratio of 1.18 (95\% posterior interval 1.13, 1.24).

  abstract = {Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is now viewed as integral to the clinical care of many life-threatening brain insults, such as severe traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and malignant stroke. It serves to warn of expanding intracranial mass lesions, to prevent or treat herniation events as well as pressure elevation which impedes nutrient delivery to the brain. It facilitates the calculation of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and the estimation of cerebrovascular autoregulatory status. Despite advancements in our knowledge emanating from a half century of experience with this technology, important controversies remain related even to fundamental aspects of ICP measurements, including indications for monitoring, ICP treatment thresholds, and management of intracranial hypertension. Here, we review the history of ICP monitoring, the underlying pathophysiology as well as current perspectives on why, when and how ICP monitoring is best used. ICP is typically assessed invasively but a number of emerging, non-invasive technologies with inherently lower risk are showing promise. In selected cases, additional neuromonitoring can be used to assist in the interpretation of ICP monitoring information and adapt directed treatment accordingly. Additional efforts to expand the evidence base relevant to ICP monitoring, related technologies and management remain a high priority in neurosurgery and neurocritical care.},

First, priority should be given to reading original articles concerning reports of planned investigations because only these articles provide sufficient details to assess the relevance, validity, and clinical application of new knowledge. Second, reading should be restricted to articles of direct pertinence to one's clinical practice.

Millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and centimeters of water (cmH2O) are both used to report ICP in clinical practice and the literature. In this study, we investigated ICP unit of measure awareness in the neurosurgical community. METHODS: A survey was conducted at four US academic neurosurgery departments asking the following questions: What is your threshold for a concerning ICP? How many minutes is that ICP sustained for you to be concerned? What unit are you implying when you state that ICP? What unit of measure is an ICP reported on the monitor when transduced? When setting an external ventricular drain Becker bag level, what unit of measure do you set it to? Do you ever manually check an ICP based on a column of cerebrospinal fluid? How many cmH2O is 20~mmHg? RESULTS: An ICP of 20 and sustained for five minutes were the two most common answers. Some 71\% of residents and 34\% of attendings reported using cmH2O as the unit of measure; 18\% of residents and 24\% of attendings implied different units when discussing ICP than the unit they thought was transduced; and 53\% of residents and 34\% of attendings did not know the transduced ICP unit of measure reported in their intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: Variability and discrepancies regarding the ICP unit of measure exist in academic neurosurgery departments. Clinicians should familiarize themselves with their hospital's practices. Institutions and all of medicine may consider standardizing the ICP unit of measure, using mmHg as a universal nomenclature.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) constitutes 10\% to 15\% of all strokes and remains without a treatment of proven benefit. Despite several existing outcome prediction models for ICH, there is no standard clinical grading scale for ICH analogous to those for traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or ischemic stroke. Methods\textemdash Records of all patients with acute ICH presenting to the University of California, San Francisco during 1997\textendash 1998 were reviewed. Independent predictors of 30-day mortality were identified by logistic regression. A risk stratification scale (the ICH Score) was developed with weighting of independent predictors based on strength of association. Results\textemdash Factors independently associated with 30-day mortality were Glasgow Coma Scale score (P{$<$}0.001), age {$\geq$}80 years (P=0.001), infratentorial origin of ICH (P=0.03), ICH volume (P=0.047), and presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (P=0.052). The ICH Score was the sum of individual points assigned as follows: GCS score 3 to 4 (=2 points), 5 to 12 (=1), 13 to 15 (=0); age {$\geq$}80 years yes (=1), no (=0); infratentorial origin yes (=1), no (=0); ICH volume {$\geq$}30 cm3 (=1), {$<$}30 cm3 (=0); and intraventricular hemorrhage yes (=1), no (=0). All 26 patients with an ICH Score of 0 survived, and all 6 patients with an ICH Score of 5 died. Thirty-day mortality increased steadily with ICH Score (P{$<$}0.005). Conclusions\textemdash The ICH Score is a simple clinical grading scale that allows risk stratification on presentation with ICH. The use of a scale such as the ICH Score could improve standardization of clinical treatment protocols and clinical research studies in ICH.},

  abstract = {Background: The ICH Score is a commonly used clinical grading scale for outcome after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and has been validated for 30-day mortality, but not long-term functional outcome. The goals of this study were to assess whether the ICH Score accurately stratifies patients with regard to 12-month functional outcome and to further delineate the pace of recovery of patients during the first year post-ICH. Methods: We performed a prospective observational cohort study of all patients with acute ICH admitted to the emergency departments of San Francisco General Hospital and UCSF Medical Center from June 1, 2001, through May 31, 2004. Components of the ICH Score (admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, initial hematoma volume, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, infratentorial ICH origin, and age) were recorded along with other clinical characteristics. Patients were then assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at hospital discharge, 30 days, and 3, 6, and 12 months post-ICH. Results: Of 243 patients, 95 (39\%) died during initial acute hospitalization. The ICH Score accurately stratified patients with regard to 12-month functional outcome for various dichotomous cutpoints along the mRS (p Ͻ 0.05). Many patients continued to improve across the first year, with a small number of patients becoming disabled or dying due to late events unrelated to the initial ICH. Conclusions: The ICH Score is a valid clinical grading scale for long-term functional outcome after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Many ICH patients improve after hospital discharge and this improvement may continue even after 6 months post-ICH. Neurology\textregistered{} 2009;73:1088 \textendash 1094},

Ischemia\textendash reperfusion injury may occur with traumatic subdural hematoma (SDH). This study aimed to determine whether early induction and maintenance of hypothermia in patients with acute SDH would lead to decreased ischemia\textendash reperfusion injury and improve global neurologic outcome. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} This international, multicenter randomized controlled trial enrolled adult patients with SDH requiring evacuation of hematoma within 6 h of injury. The intervention was controlled temperature management of hypothermia to 35 \textdegree C prior to dura opening followed by 33 \textdegree C for 48 h compared with normothermia (37 \textdegree C). Investigators randomly assigned patients at a 1:1 ratio between hypothermia and normothermia. Blinded evaluators assessed outcome using a 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score. Investigators measured circulating glial fibrillary acidic protein and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 levels. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Independent statisticians performed an interim analysis of 31 patients to assess the predictive probability of success and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended the early termination of the study because of futility. Thirty-two patients, 16 per arm, were analyzed. Favorable 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended outcomes were not statistically significantly different between hypothermia vs. normothermia groups (6 of 16, 38\% vs. 4 of 16, 25\%; odds ratio 1.8 [95\% confidence interval 0.39 to {$\infty$}], p\,=\,.35). Plasma levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (p\,=\,.036), but not ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (p\,=\,.26), were lower in the patients with favorable outcome compared with those with unfavorable outcome, but differences were not identified by temperature group. Adverse events were similar between groups.},

We aimed to investigate differences in mortality and morbidity after short ({$<$}8 days) and prolonged ({$\geq$}8 days) intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Methods\hspace{0.6em} Former EPaNIC-trial patients were included in this preplanned prospective cohort, 5-year followup study. Mortality was assessed in all. For morbidity analyses, all long-stay and\textemdash for feasibility\textemdash a random sample (30\%) of short-stay survivors were contacted. Primary outcomes were total and post-28-day 5-year mortality. Secondary outcomes comprised handgrip strength (HGF, \%pred), 6-minute-walking distance (6MWD, \%pred) and SF-36 Physical Function score (PF SF-36). One-to-one propensity-score matching of shortstay and long-stay patients was performed for nutritional strategy, demographics, comorbidities, illness severity and admission diagnosis. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to explore ICU factors possibly explaining any post-ICU observed outcome differences. Results\hspace{0.6em} After matching, total and post-28-day 5-year mortality were higher for long-stayers (48.2\% (95\%CI: 43.9\% to 52.6\%) and 40.8\% (95\%CI: 36.4\% to 45.1\%)) versus short-stayers (36.2\% (95\%CI: 32.4\% to 40.0\%) and 29.7\% (95\%CI: 26.0\% to 33.5\%), p{$<$}0.001). ICU risk factors comprised hypoglycaemia, use of corticosteroids, neuromuscular blocking agents, benzodiazepines, mechanical ventilation, new dialysis and the occurrence of new infection, whereas clonidine could be protective. Among 276 long-stay and 398 short-stay 5-year survivors, HGF, 6MWD and PF SF-36 were significantly lower in long-stayers (matched subset HGF: 83\% (95\%CI: 60\% to 100\%) versus 87\% (95\%CI: 73\% to 103\%), p=0.020; 6MWD: 85\% (95\%CI: 69\% to 101\%) versus 94\% (95\%CI: 76\% to 105\%), p=0.005; PF SF-36: 65 (95\%CI: 35 to 90) versus 75 (95\%CI: 55 to 90), p=0.002). Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Longer duration of intensive care is associated with excess 5-year mortality and morbidity, partially explained by potentially modifiable ICU factors.

  abstract = {Low birth weight (LBW) infants have lower infant mortality in groups in which LBW is most frequent. For example, in 1991, US infants born to smokers had higher risks of both LBW and infant mortality than infants born to nonsmokers. However, among LBW infants, infant mortality was lower for infants born to smokers (relative rate = 0.79). There are competing theories regarding this so-called ``paradox.'' One is that maternal smoking is beneficial for LBW infants. The authors use causal diagrams to show that, even in the absence of any beneficial effect of smoking, an inverse association due to stratification on birth weight can be found. This variable is affected by the exposure of interest and shares common causes with the outcome. That is, LBW infants born to smokers may have a lower risk of mortality than other LBW infants whose LBW is due to causes associated with high mortality (e.g., birth defects). Under realistic causal diagrams, adjustment for birth weight is unwarranted when the analytical goal is to estimate overall effects of prenatal variables on infant mortality. Even for estimating direct effects of prenatal variables, adjustment for birth weight may be invalid when there is an unmeasured common cause of LBW and mortality. An appropriate justification for conditioning on birth weight requires specifying 1) the causal question motivating this analytical approach and 2) the assumptions regarding the proposed underlying biologic mechanisms.},

We describe examples of selection bias in casecontrol studies (eg, inappropriate selection of controls) and cohort studies (eg, informative censoring). We argue that the causal structure underlying the bias in each example is essentially the same: conditioning on a common effect of 2 variables, one of which is either exposure or a cause of exposure and the other is either the outcome or a cause of the outcome. This structure is shared by other biases (eg, adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure). A structural classification of bias distinguishes between biases resulting from conditioning on common effects (``selection bias'') and those resulting from the existence of common causes of exposure and outcome (``confounding''). This classification also leads to a unified approach to adjust for selection bias.},

When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment\textemdash the target experiment or target trial\textemdash that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.},

Methods We evaluated 109 survivors of ARDS at 3, 6, and 12 months and at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after discharge from the intensive care unit. At each visit, patients were interviewed and examined; underwent pulmonary-function tests, the 6-minute walk test, resting and exercise oximetry, chest imaging, and a quality-of-life evaluation; and reported their use of health care services. Results At 5 years, the median 6-minute walk distance was 436 m (76\% of predicted distance) and the Physical Component Score on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item ShortForm Health Survey was 41 (mean norm score matched for age and sex, 50). With respect to this score, younger patients had a greater rate of recovery than older patients, but neither group returned to normal predicted levels of physical function at 5 years. Pulmonary function was normal to near-normal. A constellation of other physical and psychological problems developed or persisted in patients and family caregivers for up to 5 years. Patients with more coexisting illnesses incurred greater 5-year costs.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the study was to assess the long term outcome and quality of life of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for refractory hypoxemia. METHODS: A retrospective observational study with prospective health related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment was conducted in ARDS patients who had ECMO as a rescue therapy for reversible refractory hypoxemia from January 2009 until April 2011 in a tertiary Australian centre. Survival and long-term quality of life assessment, using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and the EuroQol health related quality of life questionnaire (EQ5D) were assessed and compared to international data from other research groups. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (mean age 36.3 years) with ARDS receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia were studied. Eighteen (86\%) patients were retrieved from external intensive care units (ICUs) by a dedicated ECMO retrieval team. Eleven (55\%) had H1N1 influenza A-associated pneumonitis. Eighteen (86\%) patients survived to hospital discharge. Of the 18 survivors, ten (56\%) were discharged to other hospitals and 8 (44\%) were discharged directly home. Sequelae and health related quality of life were evaluated for 15 of the 18 (71\%) long-term survivors (assessment at median 8 months). Mean SF-36 scores were significantly lower across all domains compared to age and sex matched Australian norms. Mean SF-36 scores were lower (minimum important difference at least 5 points) than previously described ARDS survivors in the domains of general health, mental health, vitality and social function. One patient had long-term disability as a result of ICU acquired weakness. Only 26\% of survivors had returned to previous work levels at the time of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This ARDS cohort had a high survival rate (86\%) after use of ECMO support for reversible refractory hypoxemia. Long term survivors had similar physical health but decreased mental health, general health, vitality and social function compared to other ARDS survivors and an unexpectedly poor return to work.},

The objectives of this International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) review were to 1) check the currency of, and where needed, update evidence for the domain of ``basing the information in decision aids on comprehensive, critically appraised, and up-to-date syntheses of the evidence''; 2) analyze the evidence characteristics of decision aids; and 3) propose updates to relevant IPDAS criteria.                                         Methods               We searched MEDLINE and PubMed to inform updates of this domain's definitions, justifications, and components. We also searched 5 sources to identify all publicly available decision aids ( N = 471). Two assessors independently extracted each aid's evidence characteristics.                                         Results               Minor updates to the definitions and theoretical justifications of this IPDAS domain are provided and changes to relevant IPDAS criteria proposed. Nearly all aids (97\%) provided a year of creation/update, but most (81\%) did not report an explicit update or expiration policy. No scientific references were cited in 33\% of aids. Of the 314 that cited at least 1 reference, 39\% cited at least 1 guideline, 44\% cited at least 1 systematic review, and 23\% cited at least 1 randomized trial. In 35\%, it was unclear what statement in the aid the citations referred to. Only 14\% reported any of the processes used to find and decide on evidence inclusion. Only 14\% reported the evidence quality. Many emerging issues and future research areas were identified.                                         Conclusions               Although many emerging issues need to be addressed, this IPDAS domain is validated and criteria refined. High-quality patient decision aids should be based on comprehensive and up-to-date syntheses of critically appraised evidence.},

We examine whether this racial bias is related to false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites (e.g., ``black people's skin is thicker than white people's skin''). Study 1 documented these beliefs among white laypersons and revealed that participants who more strongly endorsed false beliefs about biological differences reported lower pain ratings for a black (vs. white) target. Study 2 extended these findings to the medical context and found that half of a sample of white medical students and residents endorsed these beliefs. Moreover, participants who endorsed these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient's pain as lower and made less accurate treatment recommendations. Participants who did not endorse these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient's pain as higher, but showed no bias in treatment recommendations. These findings suggest that individuals with at least some medical training hold and may use false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites to inform medical judgments, which may contribute to racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment.},

Clinicians, therefore, rely upon engrained treatment strategies as the dogma seems to work, or at least is assumed to do so. Evidence is often distorted, overlooked or misapplied in the re-telling. However, it is incorporated as fact in textbooks, policies, guidelines and protocols with resource and medicolegal implications. We provide here four examples of medical dogma that underline the above points: loop diuretic treatment for acute heart failure; the effectiveness of heparin thromboprophylaxis; the rate of sodium correction for hyponatraemia; and the mantra of ``each hour counts'' for treating meningitis. It is notable that the underpinning evidence is largely unsupportive of these doctrines. We do not necessarily advocate change, but rather encourage critical reflection on current practices and the need for prospective studies.},

Variation in withdrawal-of-care practices suggests the possibility of unnecessary prolongation of suffering or of unwanted deaths. OBJECTIVES: To review the available evidence on prognosis in mechanically ventilated stroke patients and to provide an overall framework to optimize decision making for clinicians, patients, and families. DATA SOURCES: Search of MEDLINE from 1980 through March 2005 for English-language articles addressing prognosis in mechanically ventilated stroke patients. From 689 articles identified, we selected 17 for further review. We also identified factors that influence, and decision-making biases that may result, in overuse or underuse of life-sustaining therapies, with a particular emphasis on mechanical ventilation. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overall mortality among mechanically ventilated stroke patients is high, with a 30-day death rate approximating 58\% (range in literature, 46\%-75\%). Although data are limited, among survivors as many as one third may have no or only slight disability, yet many others have severe disability. One can further refine prognosis according to knowledge of stroke syndromes, early patient characteristics, use of clinical prediction rules, and the need for continuing interventions. Factors influencing preferences for life-sustaining treatments include the severity and pattern of future clinical deficits, the probability of these deficits, and the burdens of treatments. Decision-making biases that may affect withdrawal-of-treatment decisions include erroneous prognostic estimates, inappropriate methods of communicating evidence, misunderstanding patient values and expectations, and failing to appreciate the extent to which patients can physically and psychologically adapt. CONCLUSIONS: Although prognosis among mechanically ventilated stroke patients is generally poor, a minority do survive without severe disability. Prognosis can be assessed according to clinical presentation and patient characteristics. There is an urgent need to better understand the marked variation in the care of these patients and to reliably measure and improve the patient-centeredness of such decisions.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The object of this study was to assess the long-term outcome and quality of life of patients who have survived with severe disability following decompressive craniectomy for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: The authors assessed outcome beyond 3 years among a cohort of 39 patients who had been adjudged either severely disabled or in vegetative state 18 months after decompressive craniectomy for TBI. Assessments performed included the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, modified Barthel Index (mBI), Zarit Burden Interview, and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The issue of retrospective consent for surgery was also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 39 eligible patients, 7 died, 12 were lost to follow-up, and 20 patients or their next of kin consented to participate in the study. Among those 20 patients, 5 in a vegetative state at 18 months remained so beyond 3 years, and the other 15 patients remained severely disabled after a median follow-up of 5 years. The patients' average daily activity per the mBI (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = -0.661, p = 0.01) and SF-36 physical score (r = -0.543, p = 0.037) were inversely correlated with the severity of TBI. However, the SF-36 mental scores of the patients were reasonably high (median 46, interquartile range 37-52). The majority of patients and their next of kin believed that they would have provided consent for surgical decompression even if they had known the eventual outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial physical recovery beyond 18 months after decompressive craniectomy for severe TBI was not observed; however, many patients appeared to have recalibrated their expectations regarding what they believed to be an acceptable quality of life.},

The current understanding of the predictors of functional outcome only in WFNS grade V SAH is limited. Journal Pre-proof Methods: WFNS grade V SAH patients were retrospectively analyzed between April 2008 and August 2019. Surgical treatment is commonly delayed until clinical improvement is observed using a less aggressive approach. Clinical and radiological data on admission were assessed, and disease-related characteristics were compared between patients with favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-3) and those with unfavorable outcomes (mRS 4-6). Results: A total of 144 patients were included, and 22 patients (15.3\%) achieved favorable outcomes, whereas 122 patients (84.7\%) had unfavorable outcomes. Surgical aneurysm repair was performed in all patients with favorable outcomes and in 21.3\% of those with unfavorable outcomes. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that GCS 3, high-grade Early Brain Edema Score (EBES), absence of bilaterally light reflex and neurological improvement, and hypertension were significantly associated with unfavorable outcomes (OR 9.54, P=0.03; OR 5.37, P=0.04; OR 11.80, P=0.009; OR 0.14, P=0.02 and OR 6.53, P=0.04, respectively).

  abstract = {Objective To estimate the proportion of healthcare interventions tested within Cochrane Reviews that are effective according to high-quality evidence. Methods We selected a random sample of 2,428 (35\%) of all Cochrane Reviews published between 1 January 2008 and 5 March 2021. We extracted data about interventions within these reviews that were compared with placebo, or no treatment, and whose outcome quality was rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. We calculated the proportion of interventions whose benefits were based on high-quality evidence (defined as having high quality GRADE rating for at least one primary outcome, statistically significant positive results, and being judged by review authors as effective. We also calculated the proportion of interventions that suggested harm. Results Of 1,567 eligible interventions, 87 (5.6\%) had high-quality evidence supporting their benefits. Harms were measured for 577 (36.8\%) interventions. There was statistically significant evidence for harm in 127 (8.1\%) of these. Our dependence on the reliability of Cochrane author assessments (including their GRADE assessments) was the main potential limitation of our study. Conclusion More than 9 in 10 healthcare interventions studied within recent Cochrane Reviews are not supported by high-quality evidence, and harms are under-reported.},

  abstract = {Background: The accurate diagnosis of a disease is a prerequisite for its appropriate treatment. How well a medical test is able to correctly identify or rule out a target disease can be assessed by diagnostic accuracy studies. Methods: The main statistical parameters that are derived from diagnostic accuracy studies, and their proper interpretation, will be presented here in the light of publications retrieved by a selective literature search, supplemented by the authors' own experience. Aspects of study planning and the analysis of complex studies on diagnostic tests will also be discussed. Results: In the usual case, the findings of a diagnostic accuracy study are presented in a 2 \texttimes{} 2 contingency table containing the number of true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and true-positive test results. This information allows the calculation of various statistical parameters, of which the most important are the two pairs sensitivity/specificity and positive/negative predictive value. All of these parameters are quotients, with the number of true positive (resp. true negative) test results in the numerator; the denominator is, in the first pair, the total number of ill (resp. healthy) patients, and in the second pair, the total number of patients with a positive (resp. negative) test. The predictive values are the parameters of greatest interest to physicians and patients, but their main disadvantage is that they can easily be misinterpreted. We will also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) as additional important measures for the assessment of diagnostic tests. Further topics are discussed in the supplementary materials. Conclusion: The statistical parameters used to assess diagnostic tests are primarily based on 2 \texttimes{} 2 contingency tables. These parameters must be interpreted with care in order to draw correct conclusions for use in medical practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The inclusion of race in equations to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has become controversial. Alternative equations that can be used to achieve similar accuracy without the use of race are needed. METHODS In a large national study involving adults with chronic kidney disease, we conducted cross-sectional analyses of baseline data from 1248 participants for whom data, including the following, had been collected: race as reported by the participant, genetic ancestry markers, and the serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, and 24-hour urinary creatinine levels. RESULTS Using current formulations of GFR estimating equations, we found that in participants who identified as Black, a model that omitted race resulted in more underestimation of the GFR (median difference between measured and estimated GFR, 3.99 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.17 to 5.62) and lower accuracy (percent of estimated GFR within 10\% of measured GFR [P10], 31\%; 95\% CI, 24 to 39) than models that included race (median difference, 1.11 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, -0.29 to 2.54; P10, 42\%; 95\% CI, 34 to 50). The incorporation of genetic ancestry data instead of race resulted in similar estimates of the GFR (median difference, 1.33 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, -0.12 to 2.33; P10, 42\%; 95\% CI, 34 to 50). The inclusion of non-GFR determinants of the serum creatinine level (e.g., body-composition metrics and urinary excretion of creatinine) that differed according to race reported by the participants and genetic ancestry did not eliminate the misclassification introduced by removing race (or ancestry) from serum creatinine\textendash based GFR estimating equations. In contrast, the incorporation of race or ancestry was not necessary to achieve similarly statistically unbiased (median difference, 0.33 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, -1.43 to 1.92) and accurate (P10, 41\%; 95\% CI, 34 to 49) estimates in Black participants when GFR was estimated with the use of cystatin C.

CONCLUSIONS The use of the serum creatinine level to estimate the GFR without race (or genetic ancestry) introduced systematic misclassification that could not be eliminated even when numerous non-GFR determinants of the serum creatinine level were accounted for.

  abstract = {Learning about cause and effect is arguably the main goal in applied econometrics. In practice, the validity of these causal inferences is contingent on a number of critical assumptions regarding the type of data that has been collected and the substantive knowledge that is available. For instance, unobserved confounding factors threaten the internal validity of estimates, data availability is often limited to non-random, selection-biased samples, causal effects need to be learned from surrogate experiments with imperfect compliance, and causal knowledge has to be extrapolated across structurally heterogeneous populations. A powerful causal inference framework is required to tackle these challenges, which plague most data analysis to varying degrees. Building on the structural approach to causality introduced by Haavelmo (1943) and the graph-theoretic framework proposed by Pearl (1995), the artificial intelligence (AI) literature has developed a wide array of techniques for causal learning that allow to leverage information from various imperfect, heterogeneous, and biased data sources (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016). In this paper, we discuss recent advances in this literature that have the potential to contribute to econometric methodology along three dimensions. First, they provide a unified and comprehensive framework for causal inference, in which the aforementioned problems can be addressed in full generality. Second, due to their origin in AI, they come together with sound, efficient, and complete algorithmic criteria for automatization of the corresponding identification task. And third, because of the nonparametric description of structural models that graph-theoretic approaches build on, they combine the strengths of both structural econometrics as well as the potential outcomes framework, and thus offer an effective middle ground between these two literature streams.},

We compared the occurrence of HE and clinical outcomes in patients treated either with andexanet alfa or with usual care during the acute phase of factor-Xa inhibitor\textendash related ICH. METHODS: Data were extracted from the multicenter, prospective, single-arm ANNEXA-4 trial (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of Factor Xa Inhibitors) and a multicenter observational cohort study, RETRACE-II (GermanWide Multicenter Analysis of Oral Anticoagulant-Associated Intracerebral Hemorrhage - Part Two). HE was based on computed tomography scans performed within 36 hours from baseline imaging. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was performed to adjust for baseline comorbidities and ICH severity. Patients presenting with atraumatic ICH while receiving apixaban or rivaroxaban within 18 hours of admission were included. Patients with secondary ICH or not fulfilling the inclusion criteria for the ANNEXA-4 trial were excluded. We compared ANNEXA-4 patients, who received andexanet alfa for hemostatic treatment, with RETRACE-II patients who were treated with usual care, primarily administration of prothrombin complex concentrates. Primary outcome was rate of HE defined as relative increase of {$\geq$}35\%. Secondary outcomes comprised mean absolute change in hematoma volume, as well as in-hospital mortality and functional outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 182 patients with factor-Xa inhibitor\textendash related ICH (85 receiving andexanet alfa versus 97 receiving usual care) were selected for analysis. There were no relevant differences regarding demographic or clinical characteristics between both groups. HE occurred in 11 of 80 (14\%) andexanet alfa patients compared with 21 of 67 (36\%) usual care patients (adjusted relative risk, 0.40 [95\% CI, 0.20\textendash 0.78]; P=0.005), with a reduction in mean overall hematoma volume change of 7 mL. There were no statistically significant differences among in-hospital mortality or functional outcomes. Sensitivity analysis including only usual care patients receiving prothrombin complex concentrates demonstrated consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with usual care, andexanet alfa was associated with a lower rate of HE in atraumatic factor-Xa inhibitor\textendash related ICH, however, without translating into significantly improved clinical outcomes. A comparative trial is needed to confirm the benefit on limiting HE and to explore clinical outcomes across patient subgroups and by time to treatment.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Targeted temperature management (TTM) is endorsed by various guidelines to improve neurologic outcomes following cardiac arrest. Shivering, a consequence of hypothermia, can counteract the benefits of TTM. Despite its frequent occurrence, consensus guidelines provide minimal guidance on the management of shivering. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a pharmacologic antishivering protocol in patients undergoing TTM following cardiac arrest on the incidence of shivering. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} A retrospective observational cohort study at a large academic medical center of adult patients who underwent TTM targeting 33 \textdegree C following out-of-hospital (OHCA) or in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) was conducted between January 2013 and January 2019. Patients were included in the preprotocol group if they received TTM prior to the initiation of a pharmacologic antishivering protocol in 2015. The primary outcome was incidence of shivering between pre- and postprotocol patients. Secondary outcomes included time from arrest (IHCA) or admission to the hospital (OHCA) to goal body temperature, total time spent at goal body temperature, and percentage of patients alive at discharge. All pharmacologic agents listed as part of the antishivering protocol were recorded. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Fifty-one patients were included in the preprotocol group, and 80 patients were included in the postprotocol group. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups, including percentage of patients experiencing OHCA (75\% vs. 63\%, p\,=\,0.15) and time from arrest to return of spontaneous circulation (17.5 vs. 17.9 min, p\,=\,0.96). Incidence of patients with shivering was significantly reduced in the postprotocol group (57\% vs. 39\%, p\,=\,0.03). Time from arrest (IHCA) or admission to the hospital (OHCA) to goal body temperature was similar in both groups (5.1 vs. 5.3 h, p\,=\,0.57), in addition to total time spent at goal body temperature (17.7 vs. 18 h, p\,=\,0.93). The percentage of patients alive at discharge was significantly improved in the postprotocol group (35\% vs. 55\%, p\,=\,0.02). Patients in the postprotocol group received significantly more buspirone (4\% vs. 73\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.01), meperidine (8\% vs. 34\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.01), and acetaminophen (12\% vs. 65\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.01) as part of the pharmacologic antishivering protocol. Use of neuromuscular blockade significantly decreased post protocol (19\% vs. 6\%, p\,=\,0.02). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} In patients undergoing TTM following cardiac arrest, the implementation of a pharmacologic antishivering protocol reduced the incidence of shivering and the use neuromuscular blocking agents.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Airway pressure release ventilation is a ventilatory mode characterized by a mandatory inverse inspiratory:expiratory ratio with a very short expiratory phase, aimed to avoid derecruitment and allow spontaneous breathing. Recent basic and clinical evidence suggests that this mode could be associated with improved outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes between airway pressure release ventilation and traditional ventilation targeting low tidal volume, in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Single-center randomized controlled trial. SETTING: ICU of a Mexican referral center dedicated to care of patients with confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. PATIENTS: Ninety adult intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Within 48 hours after intubation, patients were randomized to either receive ventilatory management with airway pressure release ventilation or continue low tidal volume ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five patients in airway pressure release ventilation group and 45 in the low tidal volume group were included. Ventilator-free days were 3.7 (0\textendash 15) and 5.2 (0\textendash 19) in the airway pressure release ventilation and low tidal volume groups, respectively (p = 0.28). During the first 7 days, patients in airway pressure release ventilation had a higher Pao2/Fio2 (mean difference, 26 [95\%CI, 13\textendash 38]; p {$<$} 0.001) and static compliance (mean difference, 3.7\,mL/cm H2O [95\% CI, 0.2\textendash 7.2]; p = 0.03), higher mean airway pressure (mean difference, 3.1\,cm H2O [95\% CI, 2.1\textendash 4.1]; p {$<$} 0.001), and higher tidal volume (mean difference, 0.76\,mL/kg/predicted body weight [95\% CI, 0.5\textendash 1.0]; p {$<$} 0.001). More patients in airway pressure release ventilation had transient severe hypercapnia, defined as an elevation of Pco2 at greater than or equal to 55 along with a pH less than 7.15 (42\% vs 15\%; p = 0.009); other outcomes were similar. Overall mortality was 69\%, with no difference between the groups (78\% in airway pressure release ventilation vs 60\% in low tidal volume; p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, when compared with low tidal volume, airway pressure release ventilation was not associated with more ventilator-free days or improvement in other relevant outcomes in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019.},

  abstract = {The effectiveness of comprehensive stroke center (CSC) capabilities on stroke mortality remains uncertain. We performed a nationwide study to examine whether CSC capabilities influenced in-hospital mortality of patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Of the 1,369 certified training institutions in Japan, 749 hospitals responded to a questionnaire survey regarding CSC capabilities that queried the availability of personnel, diagnostic techniques, specific expertise, infrastructure, and educational components recommended for CSCs. Among the institutions that responded, data on patients hospitalized for stroke between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011 were obtained from the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. In-hospital mortality was analyzed using hierarchical logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, level of consciousness on admission, comorbidities, and the number of fulfilled CSC items in each component and in total. Data from 265 institutions and 53,170 emergency-hospitalized patients were analyzed. Mortality rates were 7.8\% for patients with ischemic stroke, 16.8\% for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and 28.1\% for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Mortality adjusted for age, sex, and level of consciousness was significantly correlated with personnel, infrastructural, educational, and total CSC scores in patients with ischemic stroke. Mortality was significantly correlated with diagnostic, educational, and total CSC scores in patients with ICH and with specific expertise, infrastructural, educational, and total CSC scores in patients with SAH. CSC capabilities were associated with reduced in-hospital mortality rates, and relevant aspects of care were found to be dependent on stroke type.}

  abstract = {The use of statistical significance and p-values has become a matter of substantial controversy in various fields using statistical methods. This has gone as far as some journals banning the use of indicators for statistical significance, or even any reports of p-values, and, in one case, any mention of confidence intervals. I discuss three of the issues that have led to these often-heated debates. First, I argue that in many cases, p-values and indicators of statistical significance do not answer the questions of primary interest. Such questions typically involve making (recommendations on) decisions under uncertainty. In that case, point estimates and measures of uncertainty in the form of confidence intervals or even better, Bayesian intervals, are often more informative summary statistics. In fact, in that case, the presence or absence of statistical significance is essentially irrelevant, and including them in the discussion may confuse the matter at hand. Second, I argue that there are also cases where testing null hypotheses is a natural goal and where p-values are reasonable and appropriate summary statistics. I conclude that banning them in general is counterproductive. Third, I discuss that the overemphasis in empirical work on statistical significance has led to abuse of p-values in the form of p-hacking and publication bias. The use of pre-analysis plans and replication studies, in combination with lowering the emphasis on statistical significance may help address these problems.},

  abstract = {Selection bias remains a more difficult bias to understand than confounding or measurement error. Past definitions have not always been illuminating and a simple method (such as the change-in-estimate method for confounding) has not been available to determine its presence and magnitude in the study sample. A better understanding of the nature of the bias has led to the definition of endogenous selection bias. It is the result of conditioning on a collider variable, itself caused by two other variables; the latter variables become spuriously associated. Conditioning on a variable in the analysis that is a collider or on an indicator of sample selection has the same effect. Note that selection bias is possible even in the absence of a collider, but in the presence of endogenous selection bias, the concern is whether it is possible to identify a causal effect in the sample. Conditions have been outlined to determine that. However, even if conditions are met to identify a causal effect in the study sample, its generalization to a defined target population is not a given.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Current equations for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that use serum creatinine or cystatin C incorporate age, sex, and race to estimate measured GFR. However, race in eGFR equations is a social and not a biologic construct. METHODS We developed new eGFR equations without race using data from two development data sets: 10 studies (8254 participants, 31.5\% Black) for serum creatinine and 13 studies (5352 participants, 39.7\% Black) for both serum creatinine and cystatin C. In a validation data set of 12 studies (4050 participants, 14.3\% Black), we compared the accuracy of new eGFR equations to measured GFR. We projected the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and GFR stages in a sample of U.S. adults, using current and new equations. RESULTS In the validation data set, the current creatinine equation that uses age, sex, and race overestimated measured GFR in Blacks (median, 3.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 5.4) and to a lesser degree in non-Blacks (median, 0.5 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, 0.0 to 0.9). When the adjustment for Black race was omitted from the current eGFR equation, measured GFR in Blacks was underestimated (median, 7.1 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, 5.9 to 8.8). A new equation using age and sex and omitting race underestimated measured GFR in Blacks (median, 3.6 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, 1.8 to 5.5) and overestimated measured GFR in non-Blacks (median, 3.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95\% CI, 3.4 to 4.4). For all equations, 85\% or more of the eGFRs for Blacks and non-Blacks were within 30\% of measured GFR. New creatinine\textendash cystatin C equations without race were more accurate than new creatinine equations, with smaller differences between race groups. As compared with the current creatinine equation, the new creatinine equations, but not the new creatinine\textendash cystatin C equations, increased population estimates of CKD prevalence among Blacks and yielded similar or lower prevalence among non-Blacks.

We aimed to determine the predictors of admission, length of stay, and outcome for ICU among participants of the main Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2). INTERACT2 was an international, open, blinded endpoint, randomized controlled trial of 2839 ICH patients ({$<$}6 h) and elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) allocated to receive intensive (target SBP {$<$}140 mmHg within 1 h) or guideline-recommended (target SBP {$<$}180 mmHg) BP-lowering treatment. The primary outcome was death or major disability, defined by modified Rankin scale scores 3\textendash 6 at 90 days. Logistic regression and propensity score analyses were used to determine independent associations. Predictors of ICU admission included younger age, recruitment in China, prior ischemic/undetermined stroke, high SBP, severe stroke [National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score {$\geq$}15], large ICH volume ({$\geq$}15 mL), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) extension, early neurological deterioration, intubation and surgery. Determinants of prolonged ICU stay ({$\geq$}5 days) were prior antihypertensive use, NIHSS {$\geq$}15, large ICH volume, lobar ICH location, IVH, early neurological deterioration, intubation and surgery. ICU admission was associated with higher-risk major disability at 90-day assessment compared to those without ICU admission. This study presents prognostic variables for ICU management and outcome of ICH patients included in a large international cohort. These data may assist in the selection and counseling of patients and families concerning ICU admission.}

Empirical data suggest that across the biomedical literature (1990\textendash 2015), when abstracts use P values 96\% of them have P values of 0.05 or less. The same percentage (96\%) applies for full-text articles. Among 100 articles in PubMed, 55 report P values, while only 4 present confidence intervals for all the reported effect sizes, none use Bayesian methods and none use false-discovery rate. Over 25 years (1990\textendash 2015), use of P values in abstracts has doubled for all PubMed, and tripled for meta-analyses, while for some types of designs such as randomized trials the majority of abstracts report P values. There is major selective reporting for P values. Abstracts tend to highlight most favorable P values and inferences use even further spin to reach exaggerated, unreliable conclusions. The availability of large-scale data on P values from many papers has allowed the development and applications of methods that try to detect and model selection biases, for example, p-hacking, that cause patterns of excess significance. Inferences need to be cautious as they depend on the assumptions made by these models and can be affected by the presence of other biases (e.g., confounding in observational studies). While much of the unreliability of past and present research is driven by small, underpowered studies, NHST with P values may be also particularly problematic in the era of overpowered big data. NHST and P values are optimal only in a minority of current research. Using a more stringent threshold, as in the recently proposed shift from P {$<$} 0.05 to P {$<$} 0.005, is a temporizing measure to contain the flood and death-by-significance. NHST and P values may be replaced in many fields by other, more fit-for-purpose, inferential methods. However, curtailing selection biases requires additional measures, beyond changes in inferential methods, and in particular reproducible research practices.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of a third mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose (booster dose) against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant is uncertain, especially in older, high-risk populations. OBJECTIVE: To determine mRNA booster vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death in the Omicron era by booster type, primary vaccine type, time since primary vaccination, age, and comorbidity burden. DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study designed to emulate a target trial of booster vaccination versus no booster, conducted from 1 December 2021 to 31 March 2022. SETTING: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care system. PARTICIPANTS: Persons who had received 2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses at least 5 months earlier. INTERVENTION: Booster monovalent mRNA vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 or Moderna's mRNA-1273) versus no booster. MEASUREMENTS: Booster VE. RESULTS: Each group included 490~838 well-matched persons, who were predominantly male (88\%), had a mean age of 63.0 years (SD, 14.0), and were followed for up to 121 days (mean, 79.8 days). Booster VE more than 10 days after a booster dose was 42.3\% (95\% CI, 40.6\% to 43.9\%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 53.3\% (CI, 48.1\% to 58.0\%) against SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization, and 79.1\% (CI, 71.2\% to 84.9\%) against SARS-CoV-2-related death. Booster VE was similar for different booster types (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273), age groups, and primary vaccination regimens but was significantly higher with longer time since primary vaccination and higher comorbidity burden. LIMITATION: Predominantly male population. CONCLUSION: Booster mRNA vaccination was highly effective in preventing death and moderately effective in preventing infection and hospitalization for up to 4 months after administration in the Omicron era. Increased uptake of booster vaccination, which is currently suboptimal, should be pursued to limit the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in persons with high comorbidity burden.

In addition to testing against zero, researchers can use the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure to test for equivalence and reject the presence of a smallest effect size of interest (SESOI). The TOST procedure can be used to determine if an observed effect is surprisingly small, given that a true effect at least as extreme as the SESOI exists. We explain a range of approaches to determine the SESOI in psychological science and provide detailed examples of how equivalence tests should be performed and reported. Equivalence tests are an important extension of the statistical tools psychologists currently use and enable researchers to falsify predictions about the presence, and declare the absence, of meaningful effects.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine the change in cognitive impairment and physical functioning among patients who survive severe sepsis, controlling for their presepsis functioning. Design, Setting, and Patients A prospective cohort involving 1194 patients with 1520 hospitalizations for severe sepsis drawn from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative survey of US residents (1998-2006). A total of 9223 respondents had a baseline cognitive and functional assessment and had linked Medicare claims; 516 survived severe sepsis and 4517 survived a nonsepsis hospitalization to at least 1 follow-up survey and are included in the analysis. Main Outcome Measures Personal interviews were conducted with respondents or proxies using validated surveys to assess the presence of cognitive impairment and to determine the number of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs) for which patients needed assistance. Results Survivors' mean age at hospitalization was 76.9 years. The prevalence of moderate to severe cognitive impairment increased 10.6 percentage points among patients who survived severe sepsis, an odds ratio (OR) of 3.34 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-7.25) in multivariable regression. Likewise, a high rate of new functional limitations was seen following sepsis: in those with no limits before sepsis, a mean 1.57 new limitations (95\% CI, 0.99-2.15); and for those with mild to moderate limitations before sepsis, a mean of 1.50 new limitations (95\% CI, 0.87-2.12). In contrast, nonsepsis general hospitalizations were associated with no change in moderate to severe cognitive impairment (OR, 1.15; 95\% CI, 0.80-1.67; P for difference vs sepsis=.01) and with the development of fewer new limitations (mean among those with no limits before hospitalization, 0.48; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.57; P for difference vs sepsis Ͻ.001 and mean among those with mild to moderate limits, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.23-0.63; P for difference=.001). The declines in cognitive and physical function persisted for at least 8 years. Conclusions Severe sepsis in this older population was independently associated with substantial and persistent new cognitive impairment and functional disability among survivors. The magnitude of these new deficits was large, likely resulting in a pivotal downturn in patients' ability to live independently.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine neuropsychological function, depression, and quality of life 6 months after discharge in patients who received mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary care, medical and coronary intensive care unit of a university-based medical center. STUDY POPULATION: A total of 275 consecutive, mechanically ventilated patients from a medical intensive care unit were prospectively followed. At 6 months, 157 were alive, of whom 41 (26\%) returned for extensive follow-up testing. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Neuropsychological testing and assessment of depression and quality of life were performed at 6-month follow-up. Seven of 41 patients were excluded from further analysis due to preexisting cognitive impairment determined via surrogate interviews using the Modified Blessed Dementia Rating Scale and a review of medical records. On the basis of strict criteria derived from normative data, we found that 11 of 34 patients (32\%) were neuropsychologically impaired. Impairment was generally diffuse but occurred primarily in areas of psychomotor speed, visual and working memory, verbal fluency, and visuo-construction. The rate of neuropsychological deficits in the study population was markedly higher than population norms for mild dementia. Scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form were significantly more abnormal in the neuropsychologically impaired group than in the nonimpaired group at hospital discharge (p =.04) and at 6-month follow-up (p =.02), and clinically significant depression was found in 27\% of impaired subjects at hospital discharge and in 36\% at 6-month follow-up. No differences were observed between groups in quality of life as measured with the Short Form Health Survey-12 at discharge or 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged neuropsychological impairment is common among survivors of the medical intensive care unit and occurs with greater than anticipated frequency when compared with relevant normative data. Future investigations are warranted to elucidate the nature of the association between critical illness, neuropsychological impairment, depression, and decreased quality of life.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Childhood cardiovascular risk factors predict subclinical adult cardiovascular disease, but links to clinical events are unclear. METHODS In a prospective cohort study involving participants in the International Childhood Cardiovascular Cohorts (i3C) Consortium, we evaluated whether childhood risk factors (at the ages of 3 to 19 years) were associated with cardiovascular events in adulthood after a mean follow-up of 35 years. Body-mass index, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol level, triglyceride level, and youth smoking were analyzed with the use of i3C-derived age- and sex-specific z scores and with a combined-risk z score that was calculated as the unweighted mean of the five risk z scores. An algebraically comparable adult combined-risk z score (before any cardiovascular event) was analyzed jointly with the childhood risk factors. Study outcomes were fatal cardiovascular events and fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events, and analyses were performed after multiple imputation with the use of proportional-hazards regression.

RESULTS In the analysis of 319 fatal cardiovascular events that occurred among 38,589 participants (49.7\% male and 15.0\% Black; mean [{$\pm$}SD] age at childhood visits, 11.8{$\pm$}3.1 years), the hazard ratios for a fatal cardiovascular event in adulthood ranged from 1.30 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 1.47) per unit increase in the z score for total cholesterol level to 1.61 (95\% CI, 1.21 to 2.13) for youth smoking (yes vs. no). The hazard ratio for a fatal cardiovascular event with respect to the combined-risk z score was 2.71 (95\% CI, 2.23 to 3.29) per unit increase. The hazard ratios and their 95\% confidence intervals in the analyses of fatal cardiovascular events were similar to those in the analyses of 779 fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events that occurred among 20,656 participants who could be evaluated for this outcome. In the analysis of 115 fatal cardiovascular events that occurred in a subgroup of 13,401 participants (31.0{$\pm$}5.6 years of age at the adult measurement) who had data on adult risk factors, the adjusted hazard ratio with respect to the childhood combined-risk z score was 3.54 (95\% CI, 2.57 to 4.87) per unit increase, and the mutually adjusted hazard ratio with respect to the change in the combined-risk z score from childhood to adulthood was 2.88 (95\% CI, 2.06 to 4.05) per unit increase. The results were similar in the analysis of 524 fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective cohort study, childhood risk factors and the change in the combined-risk z score between childhood and adulthood were associated with cardiovascular events in midlife.

  abstract = {New neuroprotective treatments aimed at preventing or minimizing ``delayed brain injury'' are attractive areas of investigation and hold the potential to have substantial beneficial effects on aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) survivors. The underlying mechanisms for this ``delayed brain injury'' are multi-factorial and not fully understood. The most ideal treatment strategies would have the potential for a pleotropic effect positively modulating multiple implicated pathophysiological mechanisms at once. My personal management (RFJ) of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage closely follows those treatment recommendations contained in modern published guidelines. However, over the last 5~years, I have also utilized a novel treatment strategy, originally developed at the University of Maryland, which consists of a 14-day continuous low-dose intravenous heparin infusion (LDIVH) beginning 12~h after securing the ruptured aneurysm. In addition to its well-known anti-coagulant properties, unfractionated heparin has potent anti-inflammatory effects and through multiple mechanisms may favorably modulate the neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory processes prominent in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. In my personal series of patients treated with LDIVH, I have found significant preservation of neurocognitive function as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) compared to a control cohort of my patients treated without LDIVH (RFJ unpublished data presented at the 2015 AHA/ASA International Stroke Conference symposium on neuroinflammation in aSAH and in abstract format at the 2015 AANS/CNS Joint Cerebrovascular Section Annual Meeting). It is important for academic physicians involved in the management of these complex patients to continue to explore new treatment options that may be protective against the potentially devastating ``delayed brain injury'' following cerebral aneurysm rupture. Several of the treatment options included in this review show promise and could be carefully adopted as the level of evidence for each improves. Other proposed neuroprotective treatments like statins and magnesium sulfate were previously thought to be very promising and to varying degrees were adopted at numerous institutions based on somewhat limited human evidence. Recent clinical trials and meta-analysis have shown no benefit for these treatments, and I currently no longer utilize either treatment as prophylaxis in my practice.},

METHODS We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with molnupiravir started within 5 days after the onset of signs or symptoms in nonhospitalized, unvaccinated adults with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and at least one risk factor for severe Covid-19 illness. Participants in the trial were randomly assigned to receive 800 mg of molnupiravir or placebo twice daily for 5 days. The primary efficacy end point was the incidence hospitalization or death at day 29; the incidence of adverse events was the primary safety end point. A planned interim analysis was performed when 50\% of 1550 participants (target enrollment) had been followed through day 29.

This article was published on December 16, 2021, at NEJM.org. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2116044 Copyright \textcopyright{} 2021 Massachusetts Medical Society. RESULTS A total of 1433 participants underwent randomization; 716 were assigned to receive molnupiravir and 717 to receive placebo. With the exception of an imbalance in sex, baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The superiority of molnupiravir was demonstrated at the interim analysis; the risk of hospitalization for any cause or death through day 29 was lower with molnupiravir (28 of 385 participants [7.3\%]) than with placebo (53 of 377 [14.1\%]) (difference, -6.8 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval, -11.3 to -2.4; P\,=\,0.001). In the analysis of all participants who had undergone randomization, the percentage of participants who were hospitalized or died through day 29 was lower in the molnupiravir group than in the placebo group (6.8\% [48 of 709] vs. 9.7\% [68 of 699]; difference, -3.0 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval, -5.9 to -0.1). Results of subgroup analyses were largely consistent with these overall results; in some subgroups, such as patients with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, those with low baseline viral load, and those with diabetes, the point estimate for the difference favored placebo. One death was reported in the molnupiravir group and 9 were reported in the placebo group through day 29. Adverse events were reported in 216 of 710 participants (30.4\%) in the molnupiravir group and 231 of 701 (33.0\%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS Early treatment with molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death in at-risk, unvaccinated adults with Covid-19.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), an association which may be confounded by unobserved patient and prescriber characteristics. OBJECTIVE: We assessed for confounding in the association between PPI use and CAP by using a `falsification approach,' which estimated whether PPI use is also implausibly associated with other common medical conditions for which no known pathophysiologic link exists. DESIGN: Retrospective claims-based cohort study. SETTING: Six private U.S. health plans. SUBJECTS: Individuals who filled at least one prescription for a PPI (N=26,436) and those who never did (N=28,054) over 11 years. INTERVENTIONS: Multivariate linear regression of the association between a filled prescription for a PPI and a diagnosis of CAP in each 3-month quarter. In falsification analyses, we tested for implausible associations between PPI use in each quarter and rates of osteoarthritis, chest pain, urinary tract infection (UTI), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), skin infection, and rheumatoid arthritis. Independent variables included an indicator for whether a prescription for a PPI was filled in a given quarter, and quarterly indicators for various co-morbidities, age, income, geographic location, and marital status. KEY RESULTS: Compared to nonusers, those ever using a PPI had higher adjusted rates of CAP in quarters in which no prescription was filled (68 vs. 61 cases per 10,000 persons, p{$<$}0.001). Similar associations were noted for all conditions (e.g. chest pain, 336 vs. 282 cases, p{$<$}0.001; UTI, 151 vs. 139 cases, p{$<$}0.001). Among those ever using a PPI, quarters in which a prescription was filled were associated with higher adjusted rates of CAP (111 vs. 68 cases per 10,000, p{$<$}0.001) and all other conditions (e.g. chest pain, 597 vs. 336 cases, p{$<$}0.001; UTI, 186 vs. 151 cases, p{$<$}0.001), compared to quarters in which no prescription was filled. CONCLUSION: PPI use is associated with CAP, but also implausibly associated with common medical conditions.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models (CPMs) have become fundamental for risk stratification across healthcare. The CPM pipeline (development, validation, deployment, and impact assessment) is commonly viewed as a one-time activity, with model updating rarely considered and done in a somewhat ad hoc manner. This fails to address the fact that the performance of a CPM worsens over time as natural changes in populations and care pathways occur. CPMs need constant surveillance to maintain adequate predictive performance. Rather than reactively updating a developed CPM once evidence of deteriorated performance accumulates, it is possible to proactively adapt CPMs whenever new data becomes available. Approaches for validation then need to be changed accordingly, making validation a continuous rather than a discrete effort. As such, ``living'' (dynamic) CPMs represent a paradigm shift, where the analytical methods dynamically generate updated versions of a model through time; one then needs to validate the system rather than each subsequent model revision.},

Perturbations in oxygenation and ventilation may exacerbate secondary injury after cardiac arrest and have been shown to be associated with poor outcome. Further, patients who experience cardiac arrest are at risk for a number of other pulmonary complications. Up to 70\%~of patients experience early infection after cardiac arrest, and the respiratory tract is the most common source. Vigilance for early-onset pneumonia, as well as aggressive diagnosis and early antimicrobial agent administration are important components of critical care in this population. Patients who experience cardiac arrest are at risk for the development of ARDS. Risk factors include aspiration, pulmonary contusions (from chest compressions), systemic inflammation, and reperfusion injury. Early evidence suggests that they may benefit from ventilation with low tidal volumes. Meticulous attention to~mechanical ventilation, early assessment and optimization of respiratory gas exchange, and~therapies targeted at potential pulmonary complications may improve outcomes after cardiac~arrest.},

We created and validated a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) score, adapted to Japanese circumstances. Of the selected 1369 certified training institutions in Japan, 749 completed an acute stroke care capabilities survey. Hospital performance was determined using a 25-item score, evaluating 5 subcategories: personnel, diagnostic techniques, specific expertise, infrastructure, and education. Consistency and validity were examined using correlation coefficients and factorial analysis. The CSC score (median, 14; interquartile range, 11\textendash 18) varied according to hospital volume. The five subcategories showed moderate consistency (Cronbach's {$\alpha$} = 0.765). A strong correlation existed between types of available personnel and specific expertise. Using the 2011 Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database for patients hospitalized with stroke, four constructs were identified by factorial analysis (neurovascular surgery and intervention, vascular neurology, diagnostic neuroradiology, and neurocritical care and rehabilitation) that affected in-hospital mortality from ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The total CSC score was related to in-hospital mortality from ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR], 0.973; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.958\textendash 0.989), intracerebral hemorrhage (OR, 0.970; 95\% CI, 0.950\textendash 0.990), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR, 0.951; 95\% CI, 0.925\textendash 0.977), with varying contributions from the four constructs. The CSC score is a valid measure for assessing CSC capabilities, based on the availability of neurovascular surgery and intervention, vascular neurology, diagnostic neuroradiology, and critical care and rehabilitation services.}

This is because most studies do not attempt to describe what the treatment effect represents, and instead require readers to deduce this based on the reported statistical methods. However, this approach is fraught, as many methods provide counterintuitive results. For example, some methods include data from all patients, yet the resulting treatment effect applies only to a subset of patients, whereas other methods will exclude certain patients while results will apply to everyone. Additionally, some analyses provide estimates pertaining to hypothetical settings where patients never die or discontinue treatment. Herein we introduce estimands as a solution to the aforementioned problem. An estimand is a clear description of what the treatment effect represents, thus saving readers the necessity of trying to infer this from study methods and potentially getting it wrong. We provide examples of how estimands can remove ambiguity from reported treatment effects and describe their current use in practice. The crux of our argument is that readers should not have to infer what investigators are estimating; they should be told explicitly.},

  abstract = {Cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) involve randomizing groups of individuals (e.g. hospitals, schools or villages) to different interventions. Various approaches exist for analysing CRTs but there has been little discussion around the treatment effects (estimands) targeted by each.We describe the different estimands that can be addressed through CRTs and demonstrate how choices between different analytic approaches can impact the interpretation of results by fundamentally changing the question being asked, or, equivalently, the target estimand.CRTs can address either the participant-average treatment effect (the average treatment effect across participants) or the cluster-average treatment effect (the average treatment effect across clusters). These two estimands can differ when participant outcomes or the treatment effect depends on the cluster size (referred to as `informative cluster size'), which can occur for reasons such as differences in staffing levels or types of participants between small and large clusters. Furthermore, common estimators, such as mixed-effects models or generalized estimating equations with an exchangeable working correlation structure, can produce biased estimates for both the participant-average and cluster-average treatment effects when cluster size is informative. We describe alternative estimators (independence estimating equations and cluster-level analyses) that are unbiased for CRTs even when informative cluster size is present.We conclude that careful specification of the estimand at the outset can ensure that the study question being addressed is clear and relevant, and, in turn, that the selected estimator provides an unbiased estimate of the desired quantity.},

  abstract = {Background: An estimand is a precise description of the treatment effect to be estimated from a trial (the question) and is distinct from the methods of statistical analysis (how the question is to be answered). The potential use of estimands to improve trial research and reporting has been underpinned by the recent publication of the ICH E9(R1) Addendum on the use of estimands in clinical trials in 2019. We set out to assess how well estimands are described in published trial protocols. Methods: We reviewed 50 trial protocols published in October 2020 in Trials and BMJ Open. For each protocol, we determined whether the estimand for the primary outcome was explicitly stated, not stated but inferable (i.e. could be constructed from the information given), or not inferable. Results: None of the 50 trials explicitly described the estimand for the primary outcome, and in 74\% of trials, it was impossible to infer the estimand from the information included in the protocol. The population attribute of the estimand could not be inferred in 36\% of trials, the treatment condition attribute in 20\%, the population-level summary measure in 34\%, and the handling of intercurrent events in 60\% (the strategy for handling non-adherence was not inferable in 32\% of protocols, and the strategy for handling mortality was not inferable in 80\% of the protocols for which it was applicable). Conversely, the outcome attribute was stated for all trials. In 28\% of trials, three or more of the five estimand attributes could not be inferred. Conclusions: The description of estimands in published trial protocols is poor, and in most trials, it is impossible to understand exactly what treatment effect is being estimated. Given the utility of estimands to improve clinical research and reporting, this urgently needs to change.},

Methods: We used simulation to examine the impact of covariate adjustment on 12 outcomes from 8 studies across a range of therapeutic areas. We assessed (1) how large an increase in power can be expected in practice; and (2) the impact of adjustment for covariates that are not prognostic. Results: Adjustment for known prognostic covariates led to large increases in power for most outcomes. When power was set to 80\% based on an unadjusted analysis, covariate adjustment led to a median increase in power to 92.6\% across the 12 outcomes (range 80.6 to 99.4\%). Power was increased to over 85\% for 8 of 12 outcomes, and to over 95\% for 5 of 12 outcomes. Conversely, the largest decrease in power from adjustment for covariates that were not prognostic was from 80\% to 78.5\%. Conclusions: Adjustment for known prognostic covariates can lead to substantial increases in power, and should be routinely incorporated into the analysis of randomized trials. The potential benefits of adjusting for a small number of possibly prognostic covariates in trials with moderate or large sample sizes far outweigh the risks of doing so, and so should also be considered.},

Design, Setting, and Patients Retrospective cohort study using the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files from 1997 to 2006. We included all Medicare hospitalizations involving admission to an intensive care unit of an acute care, nonfederal hospital within the continental United States. Main Outcome Measures Overall long-term acute care utilization, associated costs, and survival following transfer. Results The number of long-term acute care hospitals in the United States increased at a mean rate of 8.8\% per year, from 192 in 1997 to 408 in 2006. During that time, the annual number of long-term acute care admissions after critical illness increased from 13 732 to 40 353, with annual costs increasing from \$484 million to \$1.325 billion. The age-standardized population incidence of long-term acute care utilization after critical illness increased from 38.1 per 100 000 in 1997 to 99.7 per 100 000 in 2006, with greater use among male individuals and black individuals in all periods. Over time, transferred patients had higher numbers of comorbidities (5.0 in 19972000 vs 5.8 in 2004-2006, PϽ.001) and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation at the long-term acute care hospital (16.4\% in 1997-2000 vs 29.8\% in 20042006, PϽ.001). One-year mortality after long-term acute care hospital admission was high throughout the study period: 50.7\% in 1997-2000 and 52.2\% in 2004-2006. Conclusions Long-term acute care hospital utilization after critical illness is common and increasing. Survival among Medicare beneficiaries transferred to long-term acute care after critical illness is poor.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with dysregulated inflammation. The effects of combination treatment with baricitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, plus remdesivir are not known. METHODS We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating baricitinib plus remdesivir in hospitalized adults with Covid-19. All the patients received remdesivir ({$\leq$}10 days) and either baricitinib ({$\leq$}14 days) or placebo (control). The primary outcome was the time to recovery. The key secondary outcome was clinical status at day 15. RESULTS A total of 1033 patients underwent randomization (with 515 assigned to combination treatment and 518 to control). Patients receiving baricitinib had a median time to recovery of 7 days (95\% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 8), as compared with 8 days (95\% CI, 7 to 9) with control (rate ratio for recovery, 1.16; 95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.32; P\,=\,0.03), and a 30\% higher odds of improvement in clinical status at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.0 to 1.6). Patients receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation at enrollment had a time to recovery of 10 days with combination treatment and 18 days with control (rate ratio for recovery, 1.51; 95\% CI, 1.10 to 2.08). The 28-day mortality was 5.1\% in the combination group and 7.8\% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.39 to 1.09). Serious adverse events were less frequent in the combination group than in the control group (16.0\% vs. 21.0\%; difference, -5.0 percentage points; 95\% CI, -9.8 to -0.3; P\,=\,0.03), as were new infections (5.9\% vs. 11.2\%; difference, -5.3 percentage points; 95\% CI, -8.7 to -1.9; P\,=\,0.003).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Five pivotal clinical trials (Intensive Insulin Therapy; Recombinant Human Activated Protein C [rhAPC]; Low-Tidal Volume; Low-Dose Steroid; Early Goal-Directed Therapy [EGDT]) demonstrated mortality reduction in patients with severe sepsis and expert guidelines have recommended them to clinical practice. Yet, the adoption of these therapies remains low among clinicians. OBJECTIVES: We selected these five trials and asked: Question 1--What is the current probability that the new therapy is not better than the standard of care in my patient with severe sepsis? Question 2--What is the current probability of reducing the relative risk of death (RRR) of my patient with severe sepsis by meaningful clinical thresholds (RRR {$>$}15\%; {$>$}20\%; {$>$}25\%)? METHODS: Bayesian methodologies were applied to this study. Odds ratio (OR) was considered for Question 1, and RRR was used for Question 2. We constructed prior distributions (enthusiastic; mild, moderate, and severe skeptic) based on various effective sample sizes of other relevant clinical trials (unfavorable evidence). Posterior distributions were calculated by combining the prior distributions and the data from pivotal trials (favorable evidence). MAIN FINDINGS: Answer 1--The analysis based on mild skeptic prior shows beneficial results with the Intensive Insulin, rhAPC, and Low-Tidal Volume trials, but not with the Low-Dose Steroid and EGDT trials. All trials' results become unacceptable by the analyses using moderate or severe skeptic priors. Answer 2--If we aim for a RRR{$>$}15\%, the mild skeptic analysis shows that the current probability of reducing death by this clinical threshold is 88\% for the Intensive Insulin, 62-65\% for the Low-Tidal Volume, rhAPC, EGDT trials, and 17\% for the Low-Dose Steroid trial. The moderate and severe skeptic analyses show no clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of death for all trials. If we aim for a RRR {$>$}20\% or {$>$}25\%, all probabilities of benefits become lower independent of the degree of skepticism. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical threshold analysis offers a new bedside tool to be directly applied to the care of patients with severe sepsis. Our results demonstrate that the strength of evidence (statistical and clinical) is weak for all trials, particularly for the Low-Dose Steroid and EGDT trials. It is essential to replicate the results of each of these five clinical trials in confirmatory studies if we want to provide patient care based on scientifically sound evidence.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and functional outcomes of intravenous alteplase among patients who were taking NOACs prior to stroke and compare outcomes with patients who were not taking long-term anticoagulants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study of 163 038 patients with acute ischemic stroke either taking NOACs or not taking anticoagulants prior to stroke and treated with intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours of symptom onset at 1752 US hospitals participating in the Get With The Guidelines\textendash Stroke program between April 2015 and March 2020, with complementary data from the Addressing Real-world Anticoagulant Management Issues in Stroke registry. EXPOSURES Prestroke treatment with NOACs within 7 days prior to alteplase treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurring within 36 hours after intravenous alteplase administration. There were 4 secondary safety outcomes, including inpatient mortality, and 7 secondary functional outcomes assessed at hospital discharge, including the proportion of patients discharged home. RESULTS Of 163 038 patients treated with intravenous alteplase (median age, 70 [IQR, 59 to 81] years; 49.1\% women), 2207 (1.4\%) were taking NOACs and 160 831 (98.6\%) were not taking anticoagulants prior to their stroke. Patients taking NOACs were older (median age, 75 [IQR, 64 to 82] years vs 70 [IQR, 58 to 81] years for those not taking anticoagulants), had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities, and experienced more severe strokes (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 10 [IQR, 5 to 17] vs 7 [IQR, 4 to 14]) (all standardized differences {$>$}10). The unadjusted rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 3.7\% (95\% CI, 2.9\% to 4.5\%) for patients taking NOACs vs 3.2\% (95\% CI, 3.1\% to 3.3\%) for patients not taking anticoagulants. After adjusting for baseline clinical factors, the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was not significantly different between groups (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.88 [95\% CI, 0.70 to 1.10]; adjusted risk difference [RD], -0.51\% [95\% CI, -1.36\% to 0.34\%]). There were no significant differences in the secondary safety outcomes, including inpatient mortality (6.3\% for patients taking NOACs vs 4.9\% for patients not taking anticoagulants; adjusted OR, 0.84 [95\% CI, 0.69 to 1.01]; adjusted RD, -1.20\% [95\% CI, -2.39\% to -0\%]). Of the secondary functional outcomes, 4 of 7 showed significant differences in favor of the NOAC group after adjustment, including the proportion of patients discharged home (45.9\% vs 53.6\% for patients not taking anticoagulants; adjusted OR, 1.17 [95\% CI, 1.06 to 1.29]; adjusted RD, 3.84\% [95\% CI, 1.46\% to 6.22\%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous alteplase, use of NOACs within the preceding 7 days, compared with no use of anticoagulants, was not associated with a significantly increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage.},

  abstract = {Background South Asians (individuals from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) have high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) that cannot be explained by traditional risk factors. There are few prospective cohort studies investigating antecedents of CVD in South Asians. Objectives The Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) study is investigating the prevalence, correlates, and outcomes associated with subclinical CVD in a population-based sample of South Asian men and women age 40\textendash 79 years at 2 US clinical field centers. Population and Methodology This cohort is similar in methods and measures to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to allow for efficient cross-ethnic comparisons. Measurements obtained at the baseline examination include sociodemographic information, lifestyle and psychosocial factors, standard CVD risk factors, oral glucose tolerance testing, electrocardiography, assessment of microalbuminuria, ankle and brachial blood pressures, carotid intima-media wall thickness using ultrasonography, coronary artery calcium measurement, and abdominal visceral fat measurement using computed tomography. Blood samples will be assayed for biochemical risk factors. Between October 2010 and March 2013, we enrolled 906 South Asians with mean age of 55 {$\pm$} 9 years (46\% women; 98\% immigrants who have lived 27 {$\pm$} 11 years in the United States). The sociodemographic characteristics of this cohort are representative of US South Asians. Participants are being followed with annual telephone calls for identification of CVD events including acute myocardial infarction and other coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, therapeutic interventions for CVD, and mortality. Conclusions The MASALA study will provide novel data on the prevalence and associations of cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical atherosclerosis in South Asians living in the United States.},

  abstract = {Background: Acute myelopathies represent a heterogeneous group of disorders with distinct etiologies, clinical and radiologic features, and prognoses. Transverse myelitis (TM) is a prototype member of this group in which an immune-mediated process causes neural injury to the spinal cord, resulting in varying degrees of weakness, sensory alterations, and autonomic dysfunction. TM may exist as part of a multifocal CNS disease (eg, MS), multisystemic disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus), or as an isolated, idiopathic entity. Review Summary: In this article, we summarize recent classification and diagnostic schemes, which provide a framework for the diagnosis and management of patients with acute myelopathy. Additionally, we review the state of current knowledge about the epidemiology, natural history, immunopathogenesis, and treatment strategies for patients with TM. Conclusions: Our understanding of the classification, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of TM has recently begun to expand dramatically. With more rigorous criteria applied to distinguish acute myelopathies and with an emerging understanding of immunopathogenic events that underlie TM, it may now be possible to effectively initiate treatments in many of these disorders. Through the investigation of TM, we are also gaining a broader appreciation of the mechanisms that lead to autoimmune neurologic diseases in general.},

  abstract = {Comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries or across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the expected mortality, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no global, frequently updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly all-cause mortality data from 103 countries and territories, openly available as the regularly updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that in several worst-affected countries (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) the excess mortality was above 50\% of the expected annual mortality (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) or above 400 excess deaths per 100,000 population (Peru, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Serbia). At the same time, in several other countries (e.g. Australia and New Zealand) mortality during the pandemic was below the usual level, presumably due to social distancing measures decreasing the non-COVID infectious mortality. Furthermore, we found that while many countries have been reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, some countries have been substantially underreporting their COVID-19 deaths (e.g. Nicaragua, Russia, Uzbekistan), by up to two orders of magnitude (Tajikistan). Our results highlight the importance of open and rapid all-cause mortality reporting for pandemic monitoring.},

  abstract = {Background: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been found to be similar or superior to warfarin in reducing ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We sought to examine the anticoagulation prescription patterns in community since the advent of DOACs and also evaluate the outcomes in terms of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, ischemic stroke, and ICH in real-world patients with AF receiving anticoagulation. Methods: This is a retrospective study comprising patients who were newly diagnosed with nonvalvular AF and were prescribed anticoagulants for stroke prevention. Prescription pattern of the anticoagulants based on CHA2DS2Vasc score was studied. Clinical outcomes of GI bleeding, ischemic stroke, and ICH were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: Of the 2362 patients with AF on anticoagulation, 44.7\% were prescribed DOACs. Patients with CHA2DS2VASc score of  3 received a prescription for warfarin more often than DOACs (P {$<$} .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the incidence of GI bleed (odds ratio [OR]: 0.91, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-1.35, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .66) and stroke (OR: 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.57-1.05, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .10) was similar between warfarin and DOAC users. However, there was a trend toward lower ICH in the DOAC group (OR: 0.60, 95\% CI: 0.36-1.01, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .06). Conclusions: Prescription rate of DOACs for nonvalvular AF has increased significantly, with apixaban being the most commonly used agent. Patients with higher CHA2DS2-VASc score ( 3) are prescribed DOACs less often than warfarin. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. Given the favorable risk\textendash benefit profile of DOACs, further studies are needed to identify factors that determine anticoagulant selection in patients with AF with high thromboembolic risk.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To assess whether use of low-chloride solutions in unselected critically ill or perioperative adult patients for maintenance or resuscitation could reduce mortality and use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) when compared to high-chloride fluids. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis with random-effects inverse variance model. PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, LILACS and Web of Science were searched up until October 2016. Eligible studies included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in any language that enrolled critically ill and/or perioperative adult patients and compared a low- to a high-chloride solution for volume maintenance or resuscitation. The primary outcomes were mortality and RRT use. We conducted trial sequential analyses (TSA) and assessed risk of bias of individual trials and the overall quality of evidence. Results: Fifteen trials with 4,067 patients, most at low risk of bias, were identified. Of those, only 11 and 10 trials had data on mortality and RRT use, respectively. In the majority of the studies, there was a low study fluid exposure, in the range of 2-3L. Volumes around 7L (or above) were administered only in 3.2\% (131/4,067) of this meta-analysis\textasciiacute{} population. No statistically significant impact on mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.90; 95\% confidence interval (CI) CI 0.69 \textendash{} 1.17; p = 0.44; I2 = 0\%) or RRT use (OR 1.12; 95\%CI 0.80 \textendash{} 1.58; p = 0.52; I2 = 0\%) was found. Overall quality of evidence was moderate for both primary outcomes . TSA was performed for mortality and use of RRT. Neither the curve for mortality nor for RRT crossed the boundaries of superiority or inferiority. Available data was insufficient to calculate the futility boundary. Optimal sample size was estimated in 9,517 patients for mortality and 22,826 for RRT. Conclusions: The current evidence on low- versus high-chloride solutions for unselected critically ill or perioperative adult patients demonstrates no benefit but suffers from considerable imprecision. Results from well-conducted, adequately-powered RCTs examining sufficiently large fluid exposure are necessary.},

  abstract = {Background: Surrogate outcomes are not intrinsically beneficial to patients, but are designed to be easier and faster to measure than clinically meaningful outcomes. The use of surrogates as an endpoint in clinical trials and basis for regulatory approval is common, and frequently exceeds the guidance given by regulatory bodies. Discussion: In this article, we demonstrate that the use of surrogates in oncology is widespread and increasing. At the same time, the strength of association between the surrogates used and clinically meaningful outcomes is often unknown or weak. Attempts to validate surrogates are rarely undertaken. When this is done, validation relies on only a fraction of available data, and often concludes that the surrogate is poor. Post-marketing studies, designed to ensure drugs have meaningful benefits, are often not performed. Alternatively, if a drug fails to improve quality of life or overall survival, market authorization is rarely revoked. We suggest this reliance on surrogates, and the imprecision surrounding their acceptable use, means that numerous drugs are now approved based on small yet statistically significant increases in surrogates of questionable reliability. In turn, this means the benefits of many approved drugs are uncertain. This is an unacceptable situation for patients and professionals, as prior experience has shown that such uncertainty can be associated with significant harm. Conclusion: The use of surrogate outcomes should be limited to situations where a surrogate has demonstrated robust ability to predict meaningful benefits, or where cases are dire, rare or with few treatment options. In both cases, surrogates must be used only when continuing studies examining hard endpoints have been fully recruited.},

  abstract = {Mounting evidence suggests that there is frequently considerable variation in the risk of the outcome of interest in clinical trial populations. These differences in risk will often cause clinically important heterogeneity in treatment effects (HTE) across the trial population, such that the balance between treatment risks and benefits may differ substantially between large identifiable patient subgroups; the "average" benefit observed in the summary result may even be non-representative of the treatment effect for a typical patient in the trial. Conventional subgroup analyses, which examine whether specific patient characteristics modify the effects of treatment, are usually unable to detect even large variations in treatment benefit (and harm) across risk groups because they do not account for the fact that patients have multiple characteristics simultaneously that affect the likelihood of treatment benefit. Based upon recent evidence on optimal statistical approaches to assessing HTE, we propose a framework that prioritizes the analysis and reporting of multivariate risk-based HTE and suggests that other subgroup analyses should be explicitly labeled either as primary subgroup analyses (well-motivated by prior evidence and intended to produce clinically actionable results) or secondary (exploratory) subgroup analyses (performed to inform future research). A standardized and transparent approach to HTE assessment and reporting could substantially improve clinical trial utility and interpretability.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To describe Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who used poststroke rehabilitation services and identified the strongest predictors of utilization after the initial stroke care episode. Design: Pooled, cross-sectional design using data from 1998 to 2010 from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) with linked Medicare claims data. Setting: NA. Participants: Stroke survivors who were Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and participated in the HRS were included (NZ515). Main Outcome Measure: Utilization of rehabilitation services up to 10 years poststroke was the primary outcome with logistic regression used to predict utilization. Covariates included demographic factors, baseline functional status, health conditions, personal lifestyle factors, and social support. Results: Rehabilitation service utilization was 21.6\%, 6.8\%, 15.8\%, 16.5\%, and {$<$}16\% in years 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively. Age was the primary factor predicting use of rehabilitation in the first 10 years poststroke (odds ratio: 1.14; PZ.001). Recurrent stroke (odds ratio: 1.64; PZ.051) was also significantly associated with utilization, whereas unspecified incident stroke at incident trended toward significance (odds ratio: 2.17; PZ.077). None of the other factors was a significant predictor of participation in rehabilitation services in this period. Conclusion: A small number of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who are stroke survivors utilize rehabilitation services in the first 10 years poststroke. Of those who do, age is the primary driver of utilization. We analyzed a multitude of factors that might influence utilization, but other factors not available in these data also need to be explored.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To use the concept of reverse fragility index (RFI) to provide a measure of confidence in the neutrality of RCT results when assessed from the clinical perspective. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional study, a MEDLINE search was conducted for RCTs published from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018, in JAMA, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), and The Lancet. Eligible studies were phase 3 and 4 trials with 1:1 randomization and statistically nonsignificant binary primary end points. Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2019, to August 31, 2019. EXPOSURES Single vs multicenter enrollment, total number of events, private vs government funding, placebo vs active control, and time to event vs frequency data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the median RFI with interquartile range (IQR) at the P = .05 threshold. Secondary outcomes were the number of RCTs in which the number of participants lost to follow-up was greater than the RFI; the median RFI with IQR at different P value thresholds; the median reverse fragility quotient with IQR; and the correlation between sample sizes, number of events, and P values of the RCT and RFI. RESULTS Of the 167 RCTs included, 76 (46\%) were published in the NEJM, 50 (30\%) in JAMA, and 41 (24\%) in The Lancet. The median (IQR) sample size was 970 (470-3427) participants, and the median (IQR) number of events was 251 (105-570). The median (IQR) RFI at the P = .05 threshold was 8 (5-13). Fifty-seven RCTs (34\%) had an RFI of 5 or lower, and in 68 RCTs (41\%) the number of participants lost to follow-up was greater than the RFI. Trials with P values ranging from P = .06 to P = .10 had a median (IQR) RFI of 3 (2-4). When compared, median (IQR) RFIs were not statistically significant for single-center vs multicenter enrollment (5 [4-13] vs 8 [5-13]; P = .41), private vs government-funded studies (9 [5-13] vs 8 [5-13]; P = .34), and time-to-event primary end points vs frequency data (9 [5-14] vs 7 [4-13]; P = .43). The median (IQR) RFI at the P = .01 threshold was 12 (7-19) and at the P = .005 threshold was 14 (9-21). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cross-sectional study found that a relatively small number of events (median of 8) had to change to move the primary end point of an RCT from nonsignificant to statistically significant. These findings emphasize the nuance required when interpreting trial results that did not meet prespecified significance thresholds.},

  abstract = {Publicly available data sets hold much potential, but their unique design may require specific analytic approaches.To determine adherence to appropriate research practices for a frequently used large public database, the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).In this observational study of the 1082 studies published using the NIS from January 2015 through December 2016, a representative sample of 120 studies was systematically evaluated for adherence to practices required by AHRQ for the design and conduct of research using the NIS.None.All studies were evaluated on 7 required research practices based on AHRQ's recommendations and compiled under 3 domains: (1) data interpretation (interpreting data as hospitalization records rather than unique patients); (2) research design (avoiding use in performing state-, hospital-, and physician-level assessments where inappropriate; not using nonspecific administrative secondary diagnosis codes to study in-hospital events); and (3) data analysis (accounting for complex survey design of the NIS and changes in data structure over time).Of 120 published studies, 85\% (n\,=\,102) did not adhere to 1 or more required practices and 62\% (n\,=\,74) did not adhere to 2 or more required practices. An estimated 925 (95\% CI, 852-998) NIS publications did not adhere to 1 or more required practices and 696 (95\% CI, 596-796) NIS publications did not adhere to 2 or more required practices. A total of 79 sampled studies (68.3\% [95\% CI, 59.3\%-77.3\%]) among the 1082 NIS studies screened for eligibility did not account for the effects of sampling error, clustering, and stratification; 62 (54.4\% [95\% CI, 44.7\%-64.0\%]) extrapolated nonspecific secondary diagnoses to infer in-hospital events; 45 (40.4\% [95\% CI, 30.9\%-50.0\%]) miscategorized hospitalizations as individual patients; 10 (7.1\% [95\% CI, 2.1\%-12.1\%]) performed state-level analyses; and 3 (2.9\% [95\% CI, 0.0\%-6.2\%]) reported physician-level volume estimates. Of 27 studies (weighted; 218 studies [95\% CI, 134-303]) spanning periods of major changes in the data structure of the NIS, 21 (79.7\% [95\% CI, 62.5\%-97.0\%]) did not account for the changes. Among the 24 studies published in journals with an impact factor of 10 or greater, 16 (67\%) did not adhere to 1 or more practices, and 9 (38\%) did not adhere to 2 or more practices.In this study of 120 recent publications that used data from the NIS, the majority did not adhere to required practices. Further research is needed to identify strategies to improve the quality of research using the NIS and assess whether there are similar problems with use of other publicly available data sets.},

Activities associated with knowledge production and use are called epistemic practices. Such practices are considered in biomedical and clinical literatures, social sciences of medicine, philosophy of science and philosophy of medicine, and also in other nonmedical literatures. A host of different kinds of knowledge claims have been identified, each with different uses and logics of justification. A general framework is needed to situate these diverse contributions in medical epistemology, so we can see how they fit together. But developing such a framework turns out to be quite tricky. In this survey, three possible frameworks are considered along with the difficulties associated with each of them. The essay concludes with a fourth framework, which considers any epistemology as part of a practice that is oriented toward overcoming errors that emerge in antecedently given practices where knowledge is developed and used. As medicine indirectly advances health by directly mitigating disease, so epistemology indirectly advances knowledge by directly mitigating error.},

  abstract = {Background: The ``1-3-6-12-day rule'' for starting direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation after acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack recommends timings that may be later than used in clinical practice. We investigated more practical optimal timing of DOAC initiation according to stroke severity. Methods: The combined data of prospective registries in Japan, Stroke Acute Management with Urgent Risk-factor Assessment and Improvement-nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (September 2011 to March 2014) and RELAXED (February 2014 to April 2016) were used. Patients were divided into transient ischemic attack and 3 stroke subgroups by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score: mild (0\textendash 7), moderate (8\textendash 15), and severe ({$\geq$}16). The early treatment group was defined as patients starting DOACs earlier than the median initiation day in each subgroup. Outcomes included a composite of recurrent stroke or systemic embolism, ischemic stroke, and severe bleeding within 90 days. Six European prospective registries were used for validation. Results: In the 1797 derivation cohort patients, DOACs were started at median 2 days after transient ischemic attack and 3, 4, and 5 days after mild, moderate, and severe strokes, respectively. Stroke or systemic embolism was less common in Early Group (n=785)\textemdash initiating DOACS within 1, 2, 3, and 4 days, respectively\textemdash than Late Group (n=1012) (1.9\% versus 3.9\%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.50 [95\% CI, 0.27\textendash 0.89]), as was ischemic stroke (1.7\% versus 3.2\%, 0.54 [0.27\textendash 0.999]). Major bleeding was similarly common in the 2 groups (0.8\% versus 1.0\%). On validation, both ischemic stroke (2.4\% versus 2.2\%) and intracranial hemorrhage (0.2\% versus 0.6\%) were similarly common in Early (n=547) and Late (n=1483) Groups defined using derivation data. Conclusions: In Japanese and European populations, early DOAC initiation within 1, 2, 3, or 4 days according to stroke severity seemed to be feasible to decrease the risk of recurrent stroke or systemic embolism and no increase in major bleeding. These findings support ongoing randomized trials to better establish the optimal timing of DOAC initiation.},

The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive uses.},

  abstract = {Black and Hispanic individuals have an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) compared with their White counterparts, but no large studies of ICH have been conducted in these disproportionately affected populations.To examine the prevalence, odds, and population attributable risk (PAR) percentage for established and novel risk factors for ICH, stratified by ICH location and racial/ethnic group.The Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage Study was a case-control study of ICH among 3000 Black, Hispanic, and White individuals who experienced spontaneous ICH (1000 cases in each group). Recruitment was conducted between September 2009 and July 2016 at 19 US sites comprising 42 hospitals. Control participants were identified through random digit dialing and were matched to case participants by age ({$\pm$}5 years), sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic area. Data analyses were conducted from January 2019 to May 2020.Case and control participants underwent a standardized interview, physical measurement for body mass index, and genotyping for the {$\varepsilon$}2 and {$\varepsilon$}4 alleles of APOE, the gene encoding apolipoprotein E. Prevalence, multivariable adjusted odds ratio (OR), and PAR percentage were calculated for each risk factor in the entire ICH population and stratified by racial/ethnic group and by lobar or nonlobar location.There were 1000 Black patients (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 57 [50-65] years, 425 [42.5\%] women), 1000 Hispanic patients (median [IQR] age, 58 [49-69] years; 373 [37.3\%] women), and 1000 White patients (median [IQR] age, 71 [59-80] years; 437 [43.7\%] women). The mean (SD) age of patients with ICH was significantly lower among Black and Hispanic patients compared with White patients (eg, lobar ICH: Black, 62.2 [15.2] years; Hispanic, 62.5 [15.7] years; White, 71.0 [13.3] years). More than half of all ICH in Black and Hispanic patients was associated with treated or untreated hypertension (PAR for treated hypertension, Black patients: 53.6\%; 95\% CI, 46.4\%-59.8\%; Hispanic patients: 46.5\%; 95\% CI, 40.6\%-51.8\%; untreated hypertension, Black patients: 45.5\%; 95\% CI, 39.\%-51.1\%; Hispanic patients: 42.7\%; 95\% CI, 37.6\%-47.3\%). Lack of health insurance also had a disproportionate association with the PAR percentage for ICH in Black and Hispanic patients (Black patients: 21.7\%; 95\% CI, 17.5\%-25.7\%; Hispanic patients: 30.2\%; 95\% CI, 26.1\%-34.1\%; White patients: 5.8\%; 95\% CI, 3.3\%-8.2\%). A high sleep apnea risk score was associated with both lobar (OR, 1.68; 95\% CI, 1.36-2.06) and nonlobar (OR, 1.62; 95\% CI, 1.37-1.91) ICH, and high cholesterol was inversely associated only with nonlobar ICH (OR, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.52-0.70); both had no interactions with race and ethnicity. In contrast to the association between the {$\varepsilon$}2 and {$\varepsilon$}4 alleles of APOE and ICH in White individuals (eg, presence of APOE {$\varepsilon$}2 allele: OR, 1.84; 95\% CI, 1.34-2.52), APOE alleles were not associated with lobar ICH among Black or Hispanic individuals.This study found sleep apnea as a novel risk factor for ICH. The results suggest a strong contribution from inadequately treated hypertension and lack of health insurance to the disproportionate burden and earlier onset of ICH in Black and Hispanic populations. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing modifiable risk factors and the social determinants of health to reduce health disparities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Older patients who are hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure have high rates of physical frailty, poor quality of life, delayed recovery, and frequent rehospitalizations. Interventions to address physical frailty in this population are not well established. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate a transitional, tailored, progressive rehabilitation intervention that included four physicalfunction domains (strength, balance, mobility, and endurance). The intervention was initiated during, or early after, hospitalization for heart failure and was continued after discharge for 36 outpatient sessions. The primary outcome was the score on the Short Physical Performance Battery (total scores range from 0 to 12, with lower scores indicating more severe physical dysfunction) at 3 months. The secondary outcome was the 6-month rate of rehospitalization for any cause. RESULTS A total of 349 patients underwent randomization; 175 were assigned to the rehabilitation intervention and 174 to usual care (control). At baseline, patients in each group had markedly impaired physical function, and 97\% were frail or prefrail; the mean number of coexisting conditions was five in each group. Patient retention in the intervention group was 82\%, and adherence to the intervention sessions was 67\%. After adjustment for baseline Short Physical Performance Battery score and other baseline characteristics, the least-squares mean ({$\pm$}SE) score on the Short Physical Performance Battery at 3 months was 8.3{$\pm$}0.2 in the intervention group and 6.9{$\pm$}0.2 in the control group (mean between-group difference, 1.5; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 2.0; P{$<$}0.001). At 6 months, the rates of rehospitalization for any cause were 1.18 in the intervention group and 1.28 in the control group (rate ratio, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.66 to 1.19). There were 21 deaths (15 from cardiovascular causes) in the intervention group and 16 deaths (8 from cardiovascular causes) in the control group. The rates of death from any cause were 0.13 and 0.10, respectively (rate ratio, 1.17; 95\% CI, 0.61 to 2.27). CONCLUSIONS In a diverse population of older patients who were hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure, an early, transitional, tailored, progressive rehabilitation intervention that included multiple physical-function domains resulted in greater improvement in physical function than usual care.

  abstract = {Providing the correct level of care for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is crucial, but the level of care needed at initial presentation may not be clear. This study evaluated factors associated with admission to intensive care unit (ICU) level of care. This is an observational study of all adult patients admitted to our institution with non-traumatic supratentorial ICH presenting within 72 h of symptom onset between 2009\textendash 2012 (derivation cohort) and 2005\textendash 2008 (validation cohort). Factors associated with neuroscience ICU admission were identified via logistic regression analysis, from which a triage model was derived, refined, and retrospectively validated. For the derivation cohort, 229 patients were included, of whom 70 patients (31 \%) required ICU care. Predictors of neuroscience ICU admission were: younger age [odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95 \% CI 0.91\textendash 0.97; p = 0.0004], lower Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score (0.39, 0.28\textendash 0.54; p {$<$} 0.0001) or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (0.55, 0.45\textendash 0.67; p {$<$} 0.0001), and larger ICH volume (1.04, 1.03\textendash 1.06; p {$<$} 0.0001). The model was further refined with clinician input and the addition of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). GCS was chosen for the model rather than the FOUR score as it is more widely used. The proposed triage ICH model utilizes three variables: ICH volume {$\geq$}30 cc, GCS score {$<$}13, and IVH. The triage ICH model predicted the need for ICU admission with a sensitivity of 94.3 \% in the derivation cohort [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.88; p {$<$} 0.001] and 97.8 \% (AUC = 0.88) in the validation cohort. Presented are the derivation, refinement, and validation of the triage ICH model. This model requires prospective validation, but may be a useful tool to aid clinicians in determining the appropriate level of care at the time of initial presentation for a patient with a supratentorial ICH.},

  abstract = {Background: In the Handling Oxygenation Targets in the Intensive Care Unit (HOT-ICU) trial, a lower (8 kPa) vs a higher (12 kPa) PaO2 target did not affect mortality amongst critically ill adult patients. We used Bayesian statistics to evaluate any heterogeneity in the effect of oxygenation targets on mortality between different patient groups within the HOT-ICU trial. Methods: We analysed 90-day all-cause mortality using adjusted Bayesian logistic regression models, and assessed heterogeneous treatment effects according to four selected baseline variables using both hierarchical models of subgroups and models with interactions on the continuous scales. Results are presented as mortality probability (\%) and relative risk (RR) with 95\% credibility intervals (CrI). Results: All 2888 patients in the intention-to-treat cohort of the HOT-ICU trial were included. The adjusted 90-day mortality rates were 43.0\% (CrI: 38.3e47.8\%) and 42.3\% (CrI: 37.7e47.1\%) in the lower and higher oxygenation groups, respectively (RR 1.02 [CrI: 0.93e1.11]), with 36.5\% probability of an RR {$<$}1.00. Analyses of heterogeneous treatment effects suggested a doseeresponse relationship between baseline norepinephrine dose and increased mortality with the lower oxygenation target, with 95\% probability of increased mortality associated with the lower oxygenation target as norepinephrine doses increased. Conclusions: A lower oxygenation target was unlikely to affect overall mortality amongst critically ill adult patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. However, our results suggest an increasing mortality risk for patients with a lower oxygen target as the baseline norepinephrine dose increases. These findings warrant additional investigation.},

The relative impact of a NCCU versus NI on short- and long-term outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was assessed. 2,096 stroke patients admitted to a NCCU or nonneuro ICU at a tertiary stroke center were analyzed before the appointment of a NI, during the NI's tenure, and after the NI departed and was not replaced. Data included admission ICU type, availability of a NI, age, NIHSS, ICH score, and 3 and 12 month outcome. For AIS, compared to the time interval with a NI, departure of the NI predicted a worse rate of return to pre-stroke function at 3 months. For ICH, NCCU treatment predicted shorter ICU and hospital LOS but had no effect on short- or long-term outcomes. No effect of a NI was seen. For SAH, availability of an NI (but not an NCCU) predicted improved outcomes but longer ICU LOS. Disposition and in-hospital mortality improved when a NI was present, but continued improvement did not occur after the NI's departure. Presence of an NI was associated with improved clinical outcomes. This effect was more evident in patients with SAH. Patients with ICH tend to have poor outcomes regardless of the presence of a NCCU or a NI.}

A better understanding of long-term health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is needed. Objective: To synthesize research on long-term (at least 6 months post-ECMO) HRQOL of adults treated with ECMO. Methods: In this integrative review, we searched 3 electronic databases and did a hand search of relevant journals for articles published 2000\textendash 2019, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Thirty-one studies, representing 913 patients treated with ECMO, were included. Long-term HRQOL was slightly better for patients treated with veno-venous ECMO than veno-arterial ECMO, and mental health outcomes tended to be better than physical ones. Survivors frequently experienced physical complications, functional limitations, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms, although improvements were observed over time. Conclusions: Early identification and management of physical and mental health problems may improve HRQOL outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dural arteriovenous fistulae can present with hemorrhage, but there remains a paucity of data regarding subsequent outcomes. We sought to use the CONDOR (Consortium for Dural Arteriovenous Fistula Outcomes Research), a multi-institutional registry, to characterize the morbidity and mortality of dural arteriovenous fistula\textendash related hemorrhage. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients in CONDOR who presented with dural arteriovenous fistula\textendash related hemorrhage was performed. Patient characteristics, clinical follow-up, and radiographic details were analyzed for associations with poor outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale score {$\geq$}3). RESULTS: The CONDOR dataset yielded 262 patients with incident hemorrhage, with median follow-up of 1.4 years. Poor outcome was observed in 17.0\% (95\% CI, 12.3\%\textendash 21.7\%) at follow-up, including a 3.6\% (95\% CI, 1.3\%\textendash 6.0\%) mortality. Age and anticoagulant use were associated with poor outcome on multivariable analysis (odds ratio, 1.04, odds ratio, 5.1 respectively). Subtype of hemorrhage and venous shunting pattern of the lesion did not affect outcome significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Within the CONDOR registry, dural arteriovenous fistula\textendash related hemorrhage was associated with a relatively lower morbidity and mortality than published outcomes from other arterialized cerebrovascular lesions but still at clinically consequential rates.},

  abstract = {Trials often assess primary outcomes of traumatic brain injury at 6 months. Longer-term data are needed to assess outcomes for patients receiving surgical vs medical treatment for traumatic intracranial hypertension.To evaluate 24-month outcomes for patients with traumatic intracranial hypertension treated with decompressive craniectomy or standard medical care.Prespecified secondary analysis of the Randomized Evaluation of Surgery With Craniectomy for Uncontrollable Elevation of Intracranial Pressure (RESCUEicp) randomized clinical trial data was performed for patients with traumatic intracranial hypertension (\&gt;25 mm Hg) from 52 centers in 20 countries. Enrollment occurred between January 2004 and March 2014. Data were analyzed between 2018 and 2021. Eligibility criteria were age 10 to 65 years, traumatic brain injury (confirmed via computed tomography), intracranial pressure monitoring, and sustained and refractory elevated intracranial pressure for 1 to 12 hours despite pressure-controlling measures. Exclusion criteria were bilateral fixed and dilated pupils, bleeding diathesis, or unsurvivable injury.Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a decompressive craniectomy with standard care (surgical group) or to ongoing medical treatment with the option to add barbiturate infusion (medical group).The primary outcome was measured with the 8-point Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (1 indicates death and 8 denotes upper good recovery), and the 6- to 24-month outcome trajectory was examined.This study enrolled 408 patients: 206 in the surgical group and 202 in the medical group. The mean (SD) age was 32.3 (13.2) and 34.8 (13.7) years, respectively, and the study population was predominantly male (165 [81.7\%] and 156 [80.0\%], respectively). At 24 months, patients in the surgical group had reduced mortality (61 [33.5\%] vs 94 [54.0\%]; absolute difference, -20.5 [95\% CI, -30.8 to -10.2]) and higher rates of vegetative state (absolute difference, 4.3 [95\% CI, 0.0 to 8.6]), lower or upper moderate disability (4.7 [-0.9 to 10.3] vs 2.8 [-4.2 to 9.8]), and lower or upper severe disability (2.2 [-5.4 to 9.8] vs 6.5 [1.8 to 11.2]; {$\chi$}27\,=\,24.20, P\,=\,.001). For every 100 individuals treated surgically, 21 additional patients survived at 24 months; 4 were in a vegetative state, 2 had lower and 7 had upper severe disability, and 5 had lower and 3 had upper moderate disability, respectively. Rates of lower and upper good recovery were similar for the surgical and medical groups (20 [11.0\%] vs 19 [10.9\%]), and significant differences in net improvement ({$\geq$}1 grade) were observed between 6 and 24 months (55 [30.0\%] vs 25 [14.0\%]; {$\chi$}22\,=\,13.27, P\,=\,.001).At 24 months, patients with surgically treated posttraumatic refractory intracranial hypertension had a sustained reduction in mortality and higher rates of vegetative state, severe disability, and moderate disability. Patients in the surgical group were more likely to improve over time vs patients in the medical group.ISRCTN Identifier: 66202560},

  abstract = {Severe or life threatening infections are common among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most infections in the ICU are bacterial or fungal in origin and require antimicrobial therapy for clinical resolution. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of therapy for infected critically ill patients. However, antibiotics are often not optimally administered resulting in less favorable patient outcomes including greater mortality. The timing of antibiotics in patients with life threatening infections including sepsis and septic shock is now recognized as one of the most important deter-minants of survival for this population. Individuals who have a delay in the administration of antibiotic therapy for serious infections can have a doubling or more in their mortality. Additionally, the timing of an appropriate antibiotic regimen, one that is active against the offending pathogens based on in vitro susceptibility, also influences survival. Thus not only is early empiric antibiotic administration important but the selection of those agents is crucial as well. The duration of antibiotic infusions, especially for {$\beta$}-lactams, can also influence antibiotic efficacy by increasing antimicrobial drug exposure for the offending pathogen. However, due to mounting antibiotic resistance, aggres-sive antimicrobial de-escalation based on microbiology results is necessary to counterbalance the pressures of early broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In this review, we examine time related variables impacting antibiotic optimiza-tion as it relates to the treatment of life threatening infections in the ICU. In addition to highlighting the importance of antibiotic timing in the ICU we hope to provide an approach to antimicrobials that also minimizes the unneces-sary use of these agents. Such approaches will increasingly be linked to advances in molecular microbiology testing and artificial intelligence/machine learning. Such advances should help identify patients needing empiric antibiotic therapy at an earlier time point as well as the specific antibiotics required in order to avoid unnecessary administra-tion of broad-spectrum antibiotics.},

The aims of this study were to analyze the outcome of Hunt and Hess Grade V SAH and to compare outcomes in the current period with those of the pre\textendash International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) era as well as with published data from trials of decompressive craniectomy (DC) for middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction. METHODS\hspace{0.6em} The authors analyzed cases of Hunt and Hess Grade V SAH from 1980\textendash 1995 (referred to in this study as the earlier period) and 2005\textendash 2014 (current period) and compared the results for the 2 periods. The outcomes of 257 cases were analyzed and stratified on the basis of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores obtained 6 months after SAH. Outcomes were dichotomized as favorable (mRS score of 0\textendash 2) or unfavorable (mRS score of 3\textendash 6). Data and number needed to treat (NNT) were also compared with the results of decompressive craniectomy (DC) trials for middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarctions. RESULTS\hspace{0.6em} Early aneurysm treatment within 72 hours occurred significantly more often in the current period (in 67\% of cases vs 22\% in earlier period). In the earlier period, patients had a significantly higher 30-day mortality rate (83\% vs 39\% in the current period) and 6-month mortality rate (94\% vs 49\%), and no patient (0\%) had a favorable outcome, compared with 23\% overall in the current period (p {$<$} 0.01, OR 32), or 29.5\% of patients whose aneurysms were treated (p {$<$} 0.01, OR 219). Cerebral infarctions occurred in up to 65\% of the treated patients in the current period. Comparison with data from DC MCA trials showed that the NNTs were significantly lower in the current period with 2 for survival and 3 for mRS score of 0\textendash 3 (vs 3 and 7, respectively, for the DC MCA trials). CONCLUSIONS\hspace{0.6em} Early and aggressive treatment resulted in a significant improvement in survival rate (NNT = 2) and favorable outcome (NNT = 3 for mRS score of 0\textendash 3) for comatose patients with Hunt and Hess Grade V SAH compared with the earlier period. Independent predictors for favorable outcome were younger age and bilateral intact corneal reflexes. Despite a high rate of cerebral infarction (65\%) in the current period, 29.5\% of the patients who received treatment for their aneurysms during the current era (2005\textendash 2014) had a favorable outcome. However, careful individual decision making is essential in these cases. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2016.8.JNS161075 KEY WORDS\hspace{0.6em} subarachnoid hemorrhage; Hunt and Hess Grade V; severe SAH; clinical outcome; prognostic factors; stroke trials; coma; vascular disorders},

There are several methods to appraise volume status but none without limitations. In this review, we discuss the diagnostic utility, prognostic significance, and shortcomings of various bedside tools in the detection of fluid overload and evaluation of hemodynamic status. These include clinical examination, biomarkers, blood volume assessment, bioimpedance analysis, point-of-care ultrasound, and remote pulmonary pressure monitoring. In our opinion, clinicians must adopt a multiparametric approach offsetting the limitations of individual methods to formulate a management plan tailored to patients' needs.},

However, POCUS training and scope of practice remain relatively undefined in nephrology. The utility of diagnostic POCUS beyond kidney and vascular access is under-recognized. Assessment of fluid status is a frequent dilemma faced by nephrologists in day-to-day practice where multi-organ POCUS can enhance the sensitivity of conventional physical examination. POCUS also reduces fragmentation of care, facilitates timely diagnosis, and expedites management. While the need for further imaging studies is obviated in selected cases, POCUS is not meant to serve as an alternative to consultative imaging. In addition, utility of POCUS depends on the skills and experience of the operator, which in turn depends on the quality of training. In this review, we discuss the rationale behind nephrologists performing POCUS, discuss case examples to illustrate the basic principles of focused ultrasonography, and share our experience-based opinion about developing a POCUS training program at the institutional level.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Early administration of convalescent plasma obtained from blood donors who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may prevent disease progression in acutely ill, high-risk patients with Covid-19. METHODS In this randomized, multicenter, single-blind trial, we assigned patients who were being treated in an emergency department for Covid-19 symptoms to receive either one unit of convalescent plasma with a high titer of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or placebo. All the patients were either 50 years of age or older or had one or more risk factors for disease progression. In addition, all the patients presented to the emergency department within 7 days after symptom onset and were in stable condition for outpatient management. The primary outcome was disease progression within 15 days after randomization, which was a composite of hospital admission for any reason, seeking emergency or urgent care, or death without hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included the worst severity of illness on an 8-category ordinal scale, hospital-free days within 30 days after randomization, and death from any cause.

RESULTS A total of 511 patients were enrolled in the trial (257 in the convalescent-plasma group and 254 in the placebo group). The median age of the patients was 54 years; the median symptom duration was 4 days. In the donor plasma samples, the median titer of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies was 1:641. Disease progression occurred in 77 patients (30.0\%) in the convalescent-plasma group and in 81 patients (31.9\%) in the placebo group (risk difference, 1.9 percentage points; 95\% credible interval, -6.0 to 9.8; posterior probability of superiority of convalescent plasma, 0.68). Five patients in the plasma group and 1 patient in the placebo group died. Outcomes regarding worst illness severity and hospital-free days were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS The administration of Covid-19 convalescent plasma to high-risk outpatients within 1 week after the onset of symptoms of Covid-19 did not prevent disease progression.

  abstract = {This article explains the foundational concepts of Bayesian data analysis using virtually no mathematical notation. Bayesian ideas already match your intuitions from everyday reasoning and from traditional data analysis. Simple examples of Bayesian data analysis are presented that illustrate how the information delivered by a Bayesian analysis can be directly interpreted. Bayesian approaches to null-value assessment are discussed. The article clarifies misconceptions about Bayesian methods that newcomers might have acquired elsewhere. We discuss prior distributions and explain how they are not a liability but an important asset. We discuss the relation of Bayesian data analysis to Bayesian models of mind, and we briefly discuss what methodological problems Bayesian data analysis is not meant to solve. After you have read this article, you should have a clear sense of how Bayesian data analysis works and the sort of information it delivers, and why that information is so intuitive and useful for drawing conclusions from data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), it is unclear whether early neurological deterioration, hematoma expansion (HE), and outcome vary by supratentorial ICH location (deep versus lobar). Herein, we assessed these relationships in a clinical trial cohort that underwent brain imaging early after symptom onset. We hypothesized that HE would occur more frequently, and outcome would be worse in patients with deep ICH. METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of the FAST (Factor-VII-for-Acute-Hemorrhagic-Stroke-Treatment) trial including all patients with supratentorial hemorrhage. Enrolled patients underwent brain imaging within 3 hours of symptom onset and 24 hours after randomization. Multivariable regression was used to test the association between ICH location and 3 outcomes: HE (increase of {$\geq$}33\% or 6mL), early neurological deterioration (decrease in Glasgow Coma Scale score {$\geq$}2 points or increase in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale {$\geq$}4 points within 24 hours of admission), and 90-day outcome (modified Rankin Scale). RESULTS: Of 841 FAST trial patients, we included 728 (mean age 64 years, 38\% women) with supratentorial hemorrhages (deep n=623, lobar n=105). HE (44 versus 27\%, P=0.001) and early neurological deterioration (31 versus 17\%, P=0.001) were more common in lobar hemorrhages. Deep hemorrhages were smaller than lobar hemorrhages at baseline (12 versus 35mL, P{$<$}0.001) and 24 hours (14 versus 38mL, P{$<$}0.001). Unadjusted 90-day outcome was worse in lobar compared with deep ICH (median modified Rankin Scale score 5 versus 4, P=0.03). However, when adjusting for variables included in the ICH score including ICH volume, deep location was associated with worse and lobar location with better outcome (odds ratio lobar location, 0.58 [95\% CI, 0.38\textendash 0.89]; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this secondary analysis of randomized trial patients, lobar ICH location was associated with larger ICH volume, more HE and early neurological deterioration, and worse outcome than deep ICH. After adjustment for prognostic variables, however, deep ICH was associated with worse outcome, likely due to their proximity to eloquent brain structures.},

  abstract = {Background:               In patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage constitutes a promising therapeutic target. Intraventricular fibrinolysis (IVF) reduces mortality, yet impact on functional disability remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to determine the influence of IVF on functional outcomes.                                         Methods:               This individual participant data meta-analysis pooled 1501 patients from 2 randomized trials and 7 observational studies enrolled during 2004 to 2015. We compared IVF versus standard of care (including placebo) in patients treated with external ventricular drainage due to acute hydrocephalus caused by ICH with intraventricular hemorrhage. The primary outcome was functional disability evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS; range: 0\textendash 6, lower scores indicating less disability) at 6 months, dichotomized into mRS score: 0 to 3 versus mRS: 4 to 6. Secondary outcomes included ordinal-shift analysis, all-cause mortality, and intracranial adverse events. Confounding and bias were adjusted by random effects and doubly robust models to calculate odds ratios and absolute treatment effects (ATE).                                         Results:               Comparing treatment of 596 with IVF to 905 with standard of care resulted in an ATE to achieve the primary outcome of 9.3\% (95\% CI, 4.4\textendash 14.1). IVF treatment showed a significant shift towards improved outcome across the entire range of mRS estimates, common odds ratio, 1.75 (95\% CI, 1.39\textendash 2.17), reduced mortality, odds ratio, 0.47 (95\% CI, 0.35\textendash 0.64), without increased adverse events, absolute difference, 1.0\% (95\% CI, -2.7 to 4.8). Exploratory analyses provided that early IVF treatment ({$\leq$}48 hours) after symptom onset was associated with an ATE, 15.2\% (95\% CI, 8.6\textendash 21.8) to achieve the primary outcome.                                         Conclusions:               As compared to standard of care, the administration of IVF in patients with acute hydrocephalus caused by intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage was significantly associated with improved functional outcome at 6 months. The treatment effect was linked to an early time window {$<$}48 hours, specifying a target population for future trials.},

  abstract = {Background Tenecteplase is a modified tissue plasminogen activator with pharmacological and practical advantages over alteplase\textemdash which is currently the only approved thrombolytic drug for ischaemic stroke. The NOR-TEST trial showed that 0{$\cdot$}4 mg/kg tenecteplase had an efficacy and safety profile similar to that of a standard dose (0{$\cdot$}9 mg/kg) of alteplase, albeit in a patient population with a high prevalence of minor stroke. The aim of NOR-TEST 2 was to establish the non-inferiority of tenecteplase 0{$\cdot$}4 mg/kg to alteplase 0{$\cdot$}9 mg/kg for patients with moderate or severe ischaemic stroke. Methods This phase 3, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint, non-inferiority trial was performed at 11 hospitals with stroke units in Norway. Patients with suspected acute ischaemic stroke with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 6 or more who were eligible for thrombolysis and admitted within 4{$\cdot$}5 h of symptom onset were consecutively included. Random assignment, done by a computer with a block size of 4 and with allocations placed into opaque envelopes to be opened consecutively, was 1:1 between intravenous tenecteplase (0{$\cdot$}4 mg/kg) or standard dose alteplase (0{$\cdot$}9 mg/kg). Doctors and nurses providing acute care were not masked to treatment, but primary outcome assessment at 3 months was masked. The primary outcome was favourable functional outcome defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0\textendash 1 at 3 months, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (excluding patients who did not qualify for thrombolysis after randomisation or who withdrew informed consent). The non-inferiority margin was 3\%. This trial (NOR-TEST 2) is registered with EudraCT (number 2018\textendash 003090\textendash 95) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03854500). The trial was stopped early for safety reasons and is designated part A for analysis. Part B is ongoing with a lower dose of tenecteplase (0{$\cdot$}25 mg/kg). Findings Between Oct 28, 2019, and Sept 26, 2021, 216 patients were enrolled. Patient enrolment was stopped after a per-protocol safety review showed an imbalance in the rates of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage between the treatment groups, which surpassed the prespecified criteria for stopping the trial. Of 204 patients entering the modified intention-to-treat analysis, 100 were randomly allocated tenecteplase and 104 were allocated alteplase. All patients were followed up within 14 days of the end of the 3-months' follow-up period. A favourable functional outcome was reported less frequently in patients receiving tenecteplase (31 [32\%] of 96 patients) compared with alteplase (52 [51\%] of 101 patients; unadjusted OR 0{$\cdot$}45 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}25\textendash 0{$\cdot$}80]; p=0{$\cdot$}0064). Any intracranial haemorrhage was significantly more frequent with tenecteplase (21 [21\%] of 100 patients) than with alteplase (seven [7\%] of 104 patients; unadjusted OR 3{$\cdot$}68 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}49\textendash 9{$\cdot$}11]; p=0{$\cdot$}0031). Mortality at 3 months was also significantly higher with tenecteplase (15 [16\%] of 96 patients) than with alteplase (five [5\%] of 101 patients; unadjusted OR 3{$\cdot$}56 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}24\textendash 10{$\cdot$}21]; p=0{$\cdot$}013). Numerically more cases of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage were reported with tenecteplase (six [6\%] of 100 patients) than with alteplase (one [1\%] of 104 patients; unadjusted OR 6{$\cdot$}57 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}78\textendash 55{$\cdot$}62]; p=0{$\cdot$}061). Interpretation In this prematurely terminated study (terminated to fulfil the prespecified safety criteria), tenecteplase at a dose of 0{$\cdot$}4 mg/kg yielded worse safety and functional outcomes compared with alteplase. Our study consequently could not show that 0{$\cdot$}4 mg/kg tenecteplase is non-inferior to alteplase in moderate and severe ischaemic stroke. Future stroke trials should assess a lower dose of tenecteplase versus alteplase in patients with moderate or severe stroke. Funding The Norwegian National Programme for Clinical Therapy Research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the extent of hospital and intensive-care use at the end of life is well known, patterns of surgical care during this period are poorly understood. We examined national patterns of surgical care in the USA among elderly fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in their last year of life. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study of elderly beneficiaries of fee-for-service Medicare in the USA, aged 65 years or older, who died in 2008. We identified claims for inpatient surgical procedures in the year before death and examined the relation between receipt of an inpatient procedure and both age and geographical region. We calculated an end-of-life surgical intensity (EOLSI) score for each hospital referral region defined as proportion of decedents who underwent a surgical procedure during the year before their death, adjusted for age, sex, race, and income. We compared patient characteristics with Rao-Scott {$\chi$}(2) tests, resource use with generalised estimating equations, regional differences with generalised estimating equations Wald tests, and end-of-life surgical intensity scores with Spearman's partial-rank-order correlation coefficients. FINDINGS: Of 1,802,029 elderly beneficiaries of fee-for-service Medicare who died in 2008, 31{$\cdot$}9\% (95\% CI 31{$\cdot$}9-32{$\cdot$}0; 575,596 of 1,802,029) underwent an inpatient surgical procedure during the year before death, 18{$\cdot$}3\% (18{$\cdot$}2-18{$\cdot$}4; 329,771 of 1,802,029) underwent a procedure in their last month of life, and 8{$\cdot$}0\% (8{$\cdot$}0-8{$\cdot$}1; 144,162 of 1,802,029) underwent a procedure during their last week of life. Between the ages of 80 and 90 years, the percentage of decedents undergoing a surgical procedure in the last year of life decreased by 33\% (35{$\cdot$}3\% [95\% CI 34{$\cdot$}7-35{$\cdot$}9; 8858 of 25,094] to 23{$\cdot$}6\% [22{$\cdot$}9-24{$\cdot$}3; 3340 of 14,152]). EOLSI score in the highest intensity region (Munster, IN) was 34{$\cdot$}4 (95\% CI 33{$\cdot$}7-35{$\cdot$}1) and in the lowest intensity region (Honolulu, HI) was 11{$\cdot$}5 (11{$\cdot$}3-11{$\cdot$}7). Regions with a high number of hospital beds per head had high end-of-life surgical intensity (r=0{$\cdot$}37, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}27-0{$\cdot$}46; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), as did regions with high total Medicare spending (r=0{$\cdot$}50, 0{$\cdot$}41-0{$\cdot$}58; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). INTERPRETATION: Many elderly people in the USA undergo surgery in the year before their death. The rate at which they undergo surgery varies substantially with age and region and might suggest discretion in health-care providers' decisions to intervene surgically at the end of life.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subcortical injury resulting from conventional surgical management of intracranial hemorrhage may counteract the potential benefits of hematoma evacuation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and potential benefits of a novel, minimally invasive approach for clot evacuation in a multicenter study. METHODS: The integrated approach incorporates 5 competencies: (1) image interpretation and trajectory planning, (2) dynamic navigation, (3) atraumatic access system (BrainPath, NICO Corp, Indianapolis, Indiana), (4) extracorporeal optics, and (5) automated atraumatic resection. Twelve neurosurgeons from 11 centers were trained to use this approach through a continuing medical education-accredited course. Demographical, clinical, and radiological data of patients treated over 2~years were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirty-nine consecutive patients were identified. The median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at presentation was 10 (range, 5-15). The thalamus/basal ganglion regions were involved in 46\% of the cases. The median hematoma volume and depth were 36~mL (interquartile range [IQR], 27-65~mL) and 1.4~cm (IQR, 0.3-2.9~cm), respectively. The median time from ictus to surgery was 24.5~hours (IQR, 16-66~hours). The degree of hematoma evacuation was {$\geq$}90\%, 75\% to 89\%, and 50\% to 74\% in 72\%, 23\%, and 5.0\% of the patients, respectively. The median GCS score at discharge was 14 (range, 8-15). The improvement in GCS score was statistically significant ( P {$<$} .001). Modified Rankin Scale data were available for 35 patients. Fifty-two percent of those patients had a modified Rankin Scale score of {$\leq$}2. There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION: The approach was safely performed in all patients with a relatively high rate of clot evacuation and functional independence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is unknown when to start anticoagulation after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) from atrial fibrillation (AF). Early anticoagulation may prevent recurrent infarctions but may provoke hemorrhagic transformation as AF strokes are typically larger and hemorrhagic transformation-prone. Later anticoagulation may prevent hemorrhagic transformation but increases risk of secondary stroke in this time frame. Our aim was to compare early anticoagulation with apixaban in AF patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) versus warfarin administration at later intervals. METHODS: AREST (Apixaban for Early Prevention of Recurrent Embolic Stroke and Hemorrhagic Transformation) was an open-label, randomized controlled trial comparing the safety of early use of apixaban at day 0 to 3 for TIA, day 3 to 5 for small-sized AIS ({$<$}1.5 cm), and day 7 to 9 for medium-sized AIS ({$\geq$}1.5 cm, excluding full cortical territory), to warfarin, in a 1:1 ratio at 1 week post-TIA, or 2 weeks post-AIS. RESULTS: Although AREST ended prematurely after a national guideline focused update recommended direct oral anticoagulants over warfarin for AF, it revealed that apixaban had statistically similar yet generally numerically lower rates of recurrent strokes/TIA (14.6\% versus 19.2\%, P=0.78), death (4.9\% versus 8.5\%, P=0.68), fatal strokes (2.4\% versus 8.5\%, P=0.37), symptomatic hemorrhages (0\% versus 2.1\%), and the primary composite outcome of fatal stroke, recurrent ischemic stroke, or TIA (17.1\% versus 25.5\%, P=0.44). One symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred on warfarin, none on apixaban. Five asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation occurred in each arm. CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of anticoagulation after TIA, small-, or medium-sized AIS from AF does not appear to compromise patient safety. Potential efficacy of early initiation of anticoagulation remains to be determined from larger pivotal trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Black and Hispanic Americans have a greater risk of primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) than whites. Deep ICH is most often associated with hypertension, while lobar ICH is associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The authors conducted a population-based incidence study to directly compare the incidence of deep vs lobar ICH in all three race-ethnic groups. METHODS: The authors used an active hospital and community surveillance program and autopsy reports to identify incident ICH cases among white, black, and Caribbean Hispanic adults in Northern Manhattan between July 1993 and June 1997. Incidence rates were adjusted for age and sex to the 1990 US Census. CIs for risk ratios (RR) were calculated with Byar's chi2 approximation of the Poisson distribution. RESULTS: The authors identified 155 cases of ICH for an annual incidence of 30.9/100,000 (26.7 to 35.0). Men had a higher risk of ICH than women (RR 1.5, 95\% CI 1.2 to 1.8), driven entirely by the incidence of deep ICH (RR 1.8) rather than lobar ICH (RR 1.0). Compared with whites, RR for blacks was all ICH 3.8 (2.2 to 8.9), deep 4.8 (2.3 to 21.1), lobar 2.8 (1.2 to 14.4); RR for Hispanics was all 2.6 (1.4 to 6.1), deep 3.7 (1.7 to 16.5), lobar 1.4 (0.4 to 7.4). CONCLUSIONS: ICH is a heterogeneous disease with deep and lobar subtypes distinguishable on an epidemiologic basis. The different patterns of these two subtypes in our race-ethnically diverse population lend credence to the notion that ICH should no longer be treated as a single entity.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Clazosentan, an endothelin-1 receptor antagonist, has been shown to prevent the development of large vessel angiographic vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. We hypothesized that clazosentan can improve cerebral perfusion for territories affected by angiographically confirmed vasospasm. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} The REVERSE study (REversal of Vasospasm with clazosEntan post-aneuRysmal Subarachnoid hEmorrhage) was a prospective multicenter open-label pilot study of adult patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who received intravenous clazosentan after developing moderate to severe angiographic vasospasm. Using the radiographic data from the REVERSE study and additional retrospective radiographic data from our tertiary medical center, we compared the impact of intravenous clazosentan with intraarterial vasodilator therapy (medical standard of care) on vasospasm reversal using time to peak perfusion (TTPP; the time interval between the peak opacification of contrast dye in the main artery supplying an anatomically defined territory and the parenchymal phase when the dye is diffusely present in the brain parenchyma). Results:\hspace{0.6em} Both intravenous clazosentan (n\,=\,7 vessels) and intraarterial vasodilator therapy (n\,=\,11 vessels) resulted in a statistically significant improvement in TTPP at 24 h post intervention, when compared with the TTPP just prior to intervention for territories with angiographically confirmed severe vasospasm in the proximal arteries at baseline (linear mixed-effect model, p\,=\,0.02). The clazosentan and intraarterial vasodilator therapy groups exhibited no statisti-cally significant interaction term [time x treatment group (medical standard of care vs. clazosentan)] in our model (p\,=\,0.71), suggesting similar temporal course of two therapies. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} In our small pilot study, intravenous clazosentan administered for at least 24 h had an effect compara-ble with that of intraarterial vasodilator therapy in reversing angiographically confirmed severe vasospasm. Our results may indicate that clazosentan, in an appropriately selected patient cohort, could offer a noninvasive approach for alleviating vasospasm.},

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2001\textendash 2010) was utilized to identify patients; those with both an ICD-9 diagnosis codes for subarachnoid hemorrhage and a procedure code for aneurysm repair (either via an endovascular or surgical approach) were included. Hierarchical multivariate regression analyses were utilized to evaluate the impact of primary payer on in-hospital mortality, hospital discharge disposition, and length of hospital stay with hospital as the random effects variable. Models were adjusted for patient age, sex, race, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, hospital region, location (urban versus rural), and teaching status, procedural volume, year of admission, and the proportion of patients who underwent ventriculostomy. Subsequent models were also adjusted for time to aneurysm repair and time to ventriculostomy; subgroup analyses evaluated for those who underwent endovascular and surgical procedures separately. 15,557 hospitalizations were included. In the initial model, the adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality were higher for Medicare (OR 1.23, p,0.001), Medicaid (OR 1.23, p,0.001), and uninsured patients (OR 1.49, p,0.001) compared to those with private insurance. After also adjusting for timing of intervention, Medicaid and uninsured patients had a reduced odds of non-routine discharge (OR 0.75, p,0.001 and OR 0.42, p,0.001) despite longer hospital stays (by 8.35 days, p,0.001 and 2.45 days, p = 0.005). Variations in outcomes by primary payer\textendash including in-hospital post-procedural mortality\textendash were more pronounced for patients of all insurance types who underwent microsurgical clipping. The observed differences by primary payer are likely multifactorial, attributable to varied socioeconomic factors and the complexities of the American healthcare delivery system.},

  abstract = {Because of the strong overreliance on p values in the scientific literature, some researchers have argued that we need to move beyond p values and embrace practical alternatives. When proposing alternatives to p values statisticians often commit the ``statistician's fallacy,'' whereby they declare which statistic researchers really ``want to know.'' Instead of telling researchers what they want to know, statisticians should teach researchers which questions they can ask. In some situations, the answer to the question they are most interested in will be the p value. As long as null-hypothesis tests have been criticized, researchers have suggested including minimum-effect tests and equivalence tests in our statistical toolbox, and these tests have the potential to greatly improve the questions researchers ask. If anyone believes p values affect the quality of scientific research, preventing the misinterpretation of p values by developing better evidence-based education and user-centered statistical software should be a top priority. Polarized discussions about which statistic scientists should use has distracted us from examining more important questions, such as asking researchers what they want to know when they conduct scientific research. Before we can improve our statistical inferences, we need to improve our statistical questions.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Intravenous (IV) milrinone, in combination with induced hypertension, has been proposed as a treat-ment option for cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, data on its safety and efficacy are scarce. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} This was a controlled observational study conducted in an academic hospital with prospectively and retrospectively collected data. Consecutive patients with cerebral vasospasm following aSAH and treated with both IV milrinone (0.5 \textmu g/kg/min-1, as part of a strict protocol) and induced hypertension were compared with a historical control group receiving hypertension alone. Multivariable analyses aimed at minimizing potential biases. We assessed (1) 6-month functional disability (defined as a score between 2 and 6 on the modified Rankin Scale) and vasospasmrelated brain infarction, (2) the rate of first-line or rescue endovascular angioplasty for vasospasm, and (3) immediate tolerance to IV milrinone. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Ninety-four patients were included (41 and 53 in the IV milrinone and the control group, respectively). IV milrinone infusion was independently associated with a lower likelihood of 6-month functional disability (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\,=\,0.28, 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,0.10\textendash 0.77]) and vasospasm-related brain infarction (aOR\,=\,0.19, 95\% CI 0.04\textendash 0.94). Endovascular angioplasty was less frequent in the IV milrinone group (6 [15\%] vs. 28 [53\%] patients, p\,=\,0.0001, aOR\,=\,0.12, 95\% CI 0.04\textendash 0.38). IV milrinone (median duration of infusion, 5 [2\textendash 8] days) was prematurely discontinued owing to poor tolerance in 12 patients, mostly (n\,=\,10) for ``non/hardly-attained induced hypertension'' (mean arterial blood pressure\,{$<$}\,100 mmHg despite 1.5 \textmu g/kg/min-1 of norepinephrine). However, this event was simi-larly observed in IV milrinone and control patients (n\,=\,10 [24\%] vs. n\,=\,11 [21\%], respectively, p\,=\,0.68). IV milrinone was associated with a higher incidence of polyuria (IV milrinone patients had creatinine clearance of 191 [153\textendash 238] ml/min-1) and hyponatremia or hypokalemia, whereas arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, and thrombocytopenia were infrequent. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Despite its premature discontinuation in 29\% of patients as a result of its poor tolerance, IV milrinone was associated with a lower rate of endovascular angioplasty and a positive impact on long-term neurological and radiological outcomes. These preliminary findings encourage the conduction of confirmatory randomized trials.},

  abstract = {Objectives\hspace{0.6em} To examine the association between specialist consultation and risk of 30-day ED revisit in emergency department (ED) patients with recent-onset uncomplicated atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF/AFL). Methods\hspace{0.6em} As a secondary analysis of a previously published trial, clinical experts identified predictors of consultation including age and sex, ED sinus conversion, thromboembolic risk, heart rate, rate control medication use, coronary artery disease and anti-platelet use, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These were included in a propensity-matched hierarchical Bayesian model accounting for hospital site as a random effect, with 30-day ED revisit as the primary outcome. We also measured ED length of stay for consulted and non-consulted patients. Results\hspace{0.6em} We analyzed data from 11 sites for 829 ED patients with AF/AFL, of whom 364 (44\%) had specialist consultation. A total of 128 patients (15.4\%) had an ED revisit, 78 (16.8\%) from the no consult group and 50 (13.7\%) from the consult group. Consultation rates ranged from 8.8 to 71\% between sites. Median length of stay was 591 min (interquartile range [IQR] 359\textendash 1024) for consulted patients and 300 min (IQR 212\textendash 409) for patients without consultation. After propensitymatching, consulted patients had a 0.6\% (IQR - 4 to 3\%) lower risk of 30-day revisits than non-consulted patients (probability of lower risk 55\%). Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} In ED patients with uncomplicated AF/AFL, there was substantial between-site variation in specialist consultations; such consultation was unlikely to influence revisits within 30 days while ED length of stay was nearly double. ED specialist consultations may not be necessary for uncomplicated patients.},

  abstract = {Objectives:~         Corticosteroids may be beneficial in sepsis, but uncertainty remains over their effects in severe influenza. This systematic review updates the current evidence regarding corticosteroids in the treatment of influenza and examines the effect of dose on outcome.         Data Sources:~         Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, CENTRAL, and Web of Science) and trial registries were searched to October 2018 for randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs, and observational cohort studies reporting corticosteroid versus no corticosteroid treatment in individuals with influenza.         Study Selection and Data Extraction:~         Two researchers independently assessed studies for inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (randomized controlled trials) or Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (observational studies). Where appropriate, we estimated the effect of corticosteroids by random-effects meta-analyses using the generic inverse variance method. Meta\textendash regression analysis was used to assess the association of corticosteroid dose and mortality.         Data Synthesis:~         We identified 30 eligible studies, all observational apart from one randomized controlled trial. Twenty-one observational studies were included in the meta-analysis of mortality, which suggested an adverse association with corticosteroid therapy (odds ratio, 3.90; 95\% CI, 2.31\textendash 6.60; 15 studies; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.49; 95\% CI, 1.09\textendash 2.02; six studies). Risk of bias assessment was consistent with potential confounding by indication. Pooled analysis of seven studies showed increased odds of hospital-acquired infection in people treated with corticosteroids (unadjusted odds ratio, 2.74; 95\% CI, 1.51\textendash 4.95). Meta-regression of the effect of dose on mortality did not reveal an association, but reported doses of corticosteroids in included studies were high (mostly {$>$} 40 mg methylprednisolone [or equivalent] per day).         Conclusions:~         Corticosteroid treatment in influenza is associated with increased mortality and hospital-acquired infection, but the evidence relates mainly to high corticosteroid doses and is of low quality with potential confounding by indication a major concern.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate whether mortality varies with specific ASMs among patients with poststroke epilepsy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort study was conducted using individual-level data from linked registers on all adults in Sweden with acute stroke from July 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010, and subsequent onset of epilepsy before December 31, 2014. A total of 2577 patients receiving continuous ASM monotherapy were eligible for the study. Data were analyzed between May 27, 2019, and April 8, 2021. EXPOSURES The dispensed ASM (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code N03A) determined exposure status, and the first dispensation date marked the start of treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome, all-cause death, was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression with carbamazepine as the reference. Cardiovascular death (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes I0-I99 as the underlying cause) was assessed using Fine-Gray competing risk regression models. RESULTS A total of 2577 patients (1400 men [54\%]; median age, 78 years [IQR, 69-85 years]) were included. The adjusted hazard ratio of all-cause death compared with carbamazepine was 0.72 (95\% CI, 0.60-0.86) for lamotrigine, 0.96 (95\% CI, 0.80-1.15) for levetiracetam, 1.40 (95\% CI, 1.23-1.59) for valproic acid, 1.16 (95\% CI, 0.88-1.51) for phenytoin, and 1.16 (95\% CI, 0.81-1.66) for oxcarbazepine. The adjusted hazard ratio of cardiovascular death compared with carbamazepine was 0.76 (95\% CI, 0.61-0.95) for lamotrigine, 0.77 (95\% CI, 0.60-0.99) for levetiracetam, 1.40 (95\% CI, 1.19-1.64) for valproic acid, 1.02 (95\% CI, 0.71-1.47) for phenytoin, and 0.71 (95\% CI, 0.42-1.18) for oxcarbazepine. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cohort study's findings suggest differences in survival between patients treated with different ASMs for poststroke epilepsy. Patients receiving lamotrigine monotherapy had significantly lower mortality compared with those receiving carbamazepine. The opposite applied to patients prescribed valproic acid, who had a higher risk of cardiovascular and all-cause death. Levetiracetam was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular death compared with carbamazepine, but there was no significant difference in overall mortality.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We retrospectively reviewed patients who had non-inclusion criteria for the HYPERION trial comparing 33 \textdegree C to 37 \textdegree C in patients comatose after cardiac arrest in non-shockable rhythm, due to any cause. A good neurologi-cal outcome was defined as a day-90 Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Of the 1144 patients with non-inclusion criteria, 1130 had day-90 information and, among these, 158 (14\%) had good functional outcomes, compared to 7.9\% overall in the HYPERION trial (10.2\% with and 5.7\% without hypothermia). Considerable centre-to-centre variability was found in the proportion of non-included patients who received hypothermia (0\% to 83.8\%) and who had good day-90 functional outcomes (0\% to 31.3\%). The proportion of patients with a good day-90 functional outcome was significantly higher with than without hypothermia (18.5\% vs. 11.9\%, P\,=\,0.003). Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Our finding of better functional outcomes without than with inclusion in the HYPERION trial, despite most non-inclusion criteria being of adverse prognostic significance (e.g., long no-flow and low-flow times and haemodynamic instability), raises important questions about the choice of patient selection criteria and the applica-bility of trial results to everyday practice. At present, reserving hypothermia for patients without predictors of poor prognosis seems open to criticism.},

While outcomes from subarachnoid hemorrhage have improved in recent years, there continues to be significant interest in identifying therapeutic targets for this disease. In particular, there has been a shift in emphasis toward secondary brain injury that develops in the first 72 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage. This time period of interest is referred to as the early brain injury period and comprises processes including microcirculatory dysfunction, blood-brain-barrier breakdown, neuroinflammation, cerebral edema, oxidative cascades, and neuronal death. Advances in our understanding of the mechanisms defining the early brain injury period have been accompanied by improved imaging and nonimaging biomarkers for identifying early brain injury, leading to the recognition of an elevated clinical incidence of early brain injury compared with prior estimates. With the frequency, impact, and mechanisms of early brain injury better defined, there is a need to review the literature in this area to guide preclinical and clinical study.},

Yet evidence about recovery to preoperative levels of functional independence is limited. This study details course and predictors of functional recovery after elective major abdominal operations in the elderly. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort of 372 consecutive patients, 60 years old or more, enrolled from surgeons in private practice and two university-affiliated hospitals, assessed preoperatively and postoperatively at 1, 3, and 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, using self-report and performance-based measures (Activities of Daily Living [ADL], Instrumental Activities of Daily Living [IADL], Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Physical Component and Mental Component Scales [PCS, MCS], Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS], Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam [MMSE], timed walk, functional reach, hand grip strength). RESULTS: Mean age was 69 +/- 6 years with 56\% men, 47\% nonHispanic Caucasian, and 42\% Mexican American; hospital distribution was 49\% private, 51\% university-affiliated. Maximum functional declines (95\% CI) occurred 1 week postoperatively: ADL, 2.8 points (2.4 to 3.2); IADL, 7.6 points (7 to 8.3); SF-36 PCS, 6.5 points (5.4 to 7.6); Mini-Mental State Exam, 0.5 points (0.2 to 0.7); timed walk, 6.8 seconds (5.2 to 8.4); functional reach, 1.7 inches (1.2 to 2.2); grip strength, 2 kilograms (1.3 to 2.7) (p {$<$} 0.001 for all). SF-36 mental component scale and Geriatric Depression Scale scores did not worsen. Mean recovery times were: Mini-Mental State Exam, 3 weeks; timed walk, 6 weeks; ADL, SF-36 PCS, and functional reach, 3 months; and IADL, 6 months. Mean grip strength did not return to preoperative status by 6 months. The incidence of persistent disability at 6 months, compared with preoperative status, was: ADL, 9\%; IADL, 19\%; PCS, 16\%; mental component scale, 17\%; timed walk, 39\%; functional reach, 58\%; and grip strength, 52\%. Potentially modifiable independent predictors of ADL and IADL recovery were preoperative physical conditioning and depression plus serious postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of functional recovery varied across different measures. Protracted disability at 6 months after operation was substantial. Several potentially modifiable factors consistently predicted recovery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Younger children in a school grade cohort may be more likely to receive a diagnosis of attention deficit\textendash hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than their older peers because of age-based variation in behavior that may be attributed to ADHD rather than to the younger age of the children. Most U.S. states have arbitrary age cutoffs for entry into public school. Therefore, within the same grade, children with birthdays close to the cutoff date can differ in age by nearly 1 year. METHODS We used data from 2007 through 2015 from a large insurance database to compare the rate of ADHD diagnosis among children born in August with that among children born in September in states with and states without the requirement that children be 5 years old by September 1 for enrollment in kindergarten. ADHD diagnosis was determined on the basis of diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision. We also used prescription records to compare ADHD treatment between children born in August and children born in September in states with and states without the cutoff date of September 1. RESULTS The study population included 407,846 children in all U.S. states who were born in the period from 2007 through 2009 and were followed through December 2015. The rate of claims-based ADHD diagnosis among children in states with a September 1 cutoff was 85.1 per 10,000 children (309 cases among 36,319 children; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 75.6 to 94.2) among those born in August and 63.6 per 10,000 children (225 cases among 35,353 children; 95\% CI, 55.4 to 71.9) among those born in September, an absolute difference of 21.5 per 10,000 children (95\% CI, 8.8 to 34.0); the corresponding difference in states without the September 1 cutoff was 8.9 per 10,000 children (95\% CI, -14.9 to 20.8). The rate of ADHD treatment was 52.9 per 10,000 children (192 of 36,319 children; 95\% CI, 45.4 to 60.3) among those born in August and 40.4 per 10,000 children (143 of 35,353 children; 95\% CI, 33.8 to 47.1) among those born in September, an absolute difference of 12.5 per 10,000 children (95\% CI, 2.43 to 22.4). These differences were not observed for other month-to-month comparisons, nor were they observed in states with non-September cutoff dates for starting kindergarten. In addition, in states with a September 1 cutoff, no significant differences between August-born and September-born children were observed in rates of asthma, diabetes, or obesity. CONCLUSIONS Rates of diagnosis and treatment of ADHD are higher among children born in August than among children born in September in states with a September 1 cutoff for kindergarten entry.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Clinical trials in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) have used volume cutoffs as inclusion criteria to select populations in which the effects of interventions are likely to be the greatest. However, optimal volume cutoffs for predicting poor outcome in deep locations (thalamus versus basal ganglia) are unknown. Methods\textemdash We conducted a 2-phase study to determine ICH volume cutoffs for poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 4\textendash 6) in the thalamus and basal ganglia. Cutoffs with optimal sensitivity and specificity for poor outcome were identified in the ERICH ([Ethnic/Racial Variations of ICH] study; derivation cohort) using receiver operating characteristic curves. The cutoffs were then validated in the ATACH-2 trial (Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage-2) by comparing the c-statistic of regression models for outcome (including dichotomized volume) in the validation cohort. Results\textemdash Of the 3000 patients enrolled in ERICH, 1564 (52\%) had deep ICH, of whom 1305 (84\%) had complete neuroimaging and outcome data (660 thalamic and 645 basal ganglia hemorrhages). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified 8 mL in thalamic (area under the curve, 0.79; sensitivity, 73\%; specificity, 78\%) and 18 mL in basal ganglia ICH (area under the curve, 0.79; sensitivity, 70\%; specificity, 83\%) as optimal cutoffs for predicting poor outcome. The validation cohort included 834 (84\%) patients with deep ICH and complete neuroimaging data enrolled in ATACH-2 (353 thalamic and 431 basal ganglia hemorrhages). In thalamic ICH, the c-statistic of the multivariable outcome model including dichotomized ICH volume was 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.75\textendash 0.85) in the validation cohort. For basal ganglia ICH, the c-statistic was 0.81 (95\% CI, 0.76\textendash 0.85) in the validation cohort. Conclusions\textemdash Optimal hematoma volume cutoffs for predicting poor outcome in deep ICH vary by the specific deep brain nucleus involved. Utilization of location-specific volume cutoffs may improve clinical trial design by targeting deep ICH patients that will obtain maximal benefit from candidate therapies.\hspace{0.6em}\,{$\mkern1mu$}(Stroke. 2019;50:2044-2049.

  abstract = {Cerebral edema (i.e., ``brain swelling'') is a common complication following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Perihematomal edema (PHE) accumulates during the first 72~h after hemorrhage, and during this period, patients are at risk of clinical deterioration due to the resulting tissue shifts and brain herniation. First-line medical therapies for patients symptomatic of PHE include osmotic agents, such as mannitol in low- or high-dose bolus form, or boluses of hypertonic saline (HTS) at varied concentrations with or without subsequent continuous infusion. Decompressive craniectomy may be required for symptomatic edema refractory to osmotherapy. Other strategies that reduce PHE such as hypothermia and minimally invasive surgery have shown promise in pilot studies and are currently being evaluated in larger clinical trials. Ongoing basic, translational, and clinical research seek to better elucidate the pathophysiology of PHE to identify novel strategies to prevent edema formation as a next major advance in the treatment of ICH.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The value of administering intravenous alteplase before endovascular treatment (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke has not been studied extensively, particularly in non-Asian populations. METHODS We performed an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial in Europe involving patients with stroke who presented directly to a hospital that was capable of providing EVT and who were eligible for intravenous alteplase and EVT. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive EVT alone or intravenous alteplase followed by EVT (the standard of care). The primary end point was functional outcome on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 [no disability] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. We assessed the superiority of EVT alone over alteplase plus EVT, as well as noninferiority by a margin of 0.8 for the lower boundary of the 95\% confidence interval for the odds ratio of the two trial groups. Death from any cause and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage were the main safety end points. The authors' full names, academic degrees, and affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

The median score on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days was 3 (interquartile range, 2 to 5) with EVT alone and 2 (interquartile range, 2 to 5) with alteplase plus EVT. The adjusted common odds ratio was 0.84 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 1.15; P\,=\,0.28), which showed neither superiority nor noninferiority of EVT alone. Mortality was 20.5\% with EVT alone and 15.8\% with alteplase plus EVT (adjusted odds ratio, 1.39; 95\% CI, 0.84 to 2.30). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 5.9\% and 5.3\% of the patients in the respective groups (adjusted odds ratio, 1.30; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 2.81). CONCLUSIONS In a randomized trial involving European patients, EVT alone was neither superior nor noninferior to intravenous alteplase followed by EVT with regard to disability outcome at 90 days after stroke. The incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was similar in the two groups.

  abstract = {Methods We conducted a retrospective database study of adult patients with septic shock admitted to US hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database (from July 2010 to June 2013). We described the proportion of patients with septic shock receiving IVIG, examined IVIG regimens across sites and employed random-effects multivariable regression techniques to identify predictors of IVIG use. Results Intravenous immune globulin was administered to 0.3\% (n = 685) of patients with septic shock; with a median [interquartile range (IQR)] dose of 1 [0.5\textendash 1.8] g\'Akg-1 for a median [IQR] of 1 [1\textendash 2] day. Receipt of IVIG was less likely for Black patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.41 to 0.72) and patients without private insurance (Medicare OR, 0.73; 95\% CI 0.59 to 0.90; Medicaid OR, 0.41; 95\% CI 0.30 to 0.57) and more likely for patients with immunocompromise (OR, 6.83; 95\% CI 5.47 to 8.53), necrotizing fasciitis (OR, 9.78; 95\% CI 6.97 to 13.72), and toxic shock (OR, 56.9; 95\% CI 38.7 to 83.7). Conclusions Intravenous immune globulin is used infrequently across the US in patients with septic shock. Regimens of IVIG in septic shock may be less intensive than those associated with a survival benefit in metaanalyses. Observed infrequent use supports apparent clinical equipoise, perhaps secondary to limitations of the primary literature. A clinical trial evaluating the role of IVIG in septic shock is needed.},

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the Korean Hypothermia Network Pro registry. SETTING: Multicenter ICU. PATIENTS: Adult ({$\geq$} 18 yr) comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors who underwent targeted temperature management at 33\textendash 36\textdegree C between October 2015 and December 2018. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured the time from the end of rewarming to awakening, defined as a total Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than or equal to 9 or Glasgow Coma Scale motor score equals to 6. The primary outcome was awakening time. The secondary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcomes (poor outcome: Cerebral Performance Category 3\textendash 5). Among 1,145 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors, 477 patients (41.7\%) regained consciousness 30 hours (6\textendash 71\,hr) later, and 116 patients (24.3\%) awakened late (72\,hr after the end of rewarming). Young age, witnessed arrest, shockable rhythm, cardiac etiology, shorter time to return of spontaneous circulation, lower serum lactate level, absence of seizures, and multisedative requirement were associated with awakening. Of the 477 who woke up, 74 (15.5\%) had poor neurologic outcomes. Older age, liver cirrhosis, nonshockable rhythm, noncardiac etiology, a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and higher serum lactate levels were associated with poor neurologic outcomes. Late awakeners were more common in the poor than in the good neurologic outcome group (38/74 [51.4\%] vs 78/403 [19.4\%]; p {$<$} 0.001). The awakening time (odds ratio, 1.005; 95\% CIs, 1.003\textendash 1.008) and late awakening (odds ratio, 3.194; 95\% CIs, 1.776\textendash 5.746) were independently associated with poor neurologic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Late awakening after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was common in no withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy settings and the probability of awakening decreased over time.},

Methods: We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome was mortality, stratified by oxygen use (none, supplemental oxygen without mechanical ventilation, and mechanical ventilation). We conducted a frequentist random effects meta-analysis on the risk ratio (RR) scale and, to better contextualize the probabilistic benefits, we also performed a bayesian random effects meta-analysis on the risk difference scale. Results: We identified 8 randomized trials, totaling 9157 participants. The RR for mortality comparing remdesivir versus control was 0.71 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-1.22; I2=0.0\%) in the patients who did not require supplemental oxygen; 0.83 (95\%CI 0.73-0.95; I2=0.0\%) for nonventilated patients requiring oxygen; and 1.19 (95\%CI 0.98-1.44 I2=0.0\%) in the setting of mechanical ventilation. Using neutral priors, the probabilities that remdesivir reduces mortality were 74.7\%, 96.9\% and 8.9\%, respectively. The probability that remdesivir reduced mortality by more than 1\% was 88.1\% for nonventilated patients requiring oxygen. Conclusion: Based on this meta-analysis, there is a high probability that remdesivir reduces mortality for nonventilated patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen therapy.},

Results\textemdash{} Of 219 stroke patients who received IV rt-PA, 165 had hemispheric strokes (68 RHSs and 97 LHSs). Patients with RHSs were less hypertensive (P=0.001) and had lower pretreatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (P=0.005). LHS (odds ratio [OR], 2.29; 95\% CI, 1.14 to 4.59; P=0.019), age (OR, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.93 to 0.99; P=0.012), and pretreatment NIHSS (OR, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.78 to 0.89; P{$<$}0.0001) were independent predictors of 3-month outcome. Female sex (OR, 3; 95\% CI, 1.53 to 5.90; P=0.001) and LHS (OR, 2.07; 95\% CI, 1.05 to 4.08; P=0.03) were independent predictors of major neurological improvement at 24 hours after IV rt-PA. Conclusions\textemdash{} Despite higher pretreatment NIHSS, patients with LHSs have a 2-fold increased chance of a good outcome 3 months after rt-PA treatment compared with patients with RHSs. This gain can be clinically detected at 24 hours after treatment. These results need to be coupled with neuroimaging and hemodynamic characteristics known to influence stroke outcome.},

  abstract = {For decades, statisticians, philosophers, medical investigators and others interested in data analysis have argued that the Bayesian paradigm is the proper approach for reporting the results of scientific analyses for use by clients and readers. To date, the methods have been too complicated for non-statisticians to use. In this paper we argue that the World-Wide Web provides the perfect environment to put the Bayesian paradigm into practice: the likelihood function of the data is parsimoniously represented on the server side, the reader uses the client to represent her prior belief, and a downloaded program (a Java applet) performs the combination. In our approach, a different applet can be used for each likelihood function, prior belief can be assessed graphically, and calculation results can be reported in a variety of ways. We present a prototype implementation, BayesApplet, for two-arm clinical trials with normally-distributed outcomes, a prominent model for clinical trials. The primary implication of this work is that publishing medical research results on the Web can take a form beyond or different from that currently used on paper, and can have a profound impact on the publication and use of research results.},

Methods: Retrospective cohort, analyzing a large public database\textemdash Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care-III. Adult patients with at least 48 h of mechanical ventilation (MV), under volume controlled ventilation and an oxygenation index less than 300 mmHg were included. Results: A total of 1,142 patients had complete data and were included in the final analyses. According to a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) that included respiratory system compliance (Crs), tidal volume (Vt), driving pressure ({$\Delta$}P), plateau pressure (PPlat), PEEP, PaO2 and PaCO2 as possible exposures related to severe AKI, only Crs and PEEP levels had significant causal association with severe acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.84\textendash 0.94 for each 5-mL/cmH2O reduction in Crs; OR, 1.05 95\% CI: 1.03\textendash 1.10 for each 1-cmH2O increase of PEEP). Using mediation analysis, we examined whether any mechanical ventilation, blood gas or hemodynamic parameters could explain the effects of Csr on AKI. Only PEEP mediated the significant but small effect (less than 5\%) of Csr on severe AKI. The effects of PEEP, in turn, were not mediated by any other evaluated parameter. Several sensitivity analyses with (I) need of renal replacement therapy (RRT) as an alternative outcome and (II) only patients with Vt {$<$}8 mL/kg, confirmed our main findings. In trying to validate our DAG assumptions, we confirmed that only {$\Delta$}P was associated with mortality but not with severe AKI. Conclusions: Crs and PEEP are the only respiratory-related variables with a direct causal association in severe AKI. No mechanical ventilator or blood gas parameter mediated the effects of Crs. Approaches reducing Vt and/or {$\Delta$}P in ARDS can have limited effect on renal protection.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether moderate hypothermia (31 \textdegree C), compared with mild hypothermia (34 \textdegree C), improves clinical outcomes in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Single-center, double-blind, randomized, clinical superiority trial carried out in a tertiary cardiac care center in eastern Ontario, Canada. A total of 389 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were enrolled between August 4, 2013, and March 20, 2020, with final follow-up on October 15, 2020. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to temperature management with a target body temperature of 31 \textdegree C (n = 193) or 34 \textdegree C (n = 196) for a period of 24 hours. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was all-cause mortality or poor neurologic outcome at 180 days. Neurologic outcome was assessed using the Disability Rating Scale, with poor neurologic outcome defined as a score greater than 5 (range, 0-29, with 29 being the worst outcome [vegetative state]). There were 19 secondary outcomes, including mortality at 180 days and length of stay in the intensive care unit. RESULTS Among 367 patients included in the primary analysis (mean age, 61 years; 69 women [19\%]), 366 (99.7\%) completed the trial. The primary outcome occurred in 89 of 184 patients (48.4\%) in the 31 \textdegree C group and in 83 of 183 patients (45.4\%) in the 34 \textdegree C group (risk difference, 3.0\% [95\% CI, 7.2\%-13.2\%]; relative risk, 1.07 [95\% CI, 0.86-1.33]; P = .56). Of the 19 secondary outcomes, 18 were not statistically significant. Mortality at 180 days was 43.5\% and 41.0\% in patients treated with a target temperature of 31 \textdegree C and 34 \textdegree C, respectively (P = .63). The median length of stay in the intensive care unit was longer in the 31 \textdegree C group (10 vs 7 days; P = .004). Among adverse events in the 31 \textdegree C group vs the 34 \textdegree C group, deep vein thrombosis occurred in 11.4\% vs 10.9\% and thrombus in the inferior vena cava occurred in 3.8\% and 7.7\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, a target temperature of 31 \textdegree C did not significantly reduce the rate of death or poor neurologic outcome at 180 days compared with a target temperature of 34 \textdegree C. However, the study may have been underpowered to detect a clinically important difference.},

A number of studies have emerged challenging this by demonstrating that overweight and early obese states are associated with improved survival. This finding is termed the Bobesity paradox\^ and is well recognized in the cardio-metabolic literature but less so in oncology. Here, we summarize the epidemiological findings related to the obesity paradox in cancer. Our review highlights that many observations of the obesity paradox in cancer reflect methodological mechanisms including the crudeness of BMI as an obesity measure, confounding, detection bias, reverse causality, and a specific form of the selection bias, known as collider bias. It is imperative for the oncologist to interpret the observation of the obesity paradox against the above methodological framework and avoid the misinterpretation that being obese might be Bgood\^ or Bprotective\^ for cancer patients.},

In this article Jeanne Lenzer uses the example of guidelines produced by the American Heart Association to discuss some of the questions that can arise when interests conflict As doctors and the public become more aware of conflicts of interest involving study bias,1 publication bias,2 and industry gift giving3 they turn to credible non-profit organisations for sound medical recommendations. Unfortunately, many groups (and their individual panellists) that serve as arbiters of inconclusive data may also suffer from conflicts of interest. 4 5 One such conflict is self referencing bias. An example of this is in specialty guidelines for colon cancer screening, where radiologists recommend barium enemas while gastroenterologists recommend colonoscopy. A more important conflict arises when corporations with a financial stake in the recommendations issued by a non-profit making organisation provide financial support for that organisation. In this paper I examine an example of such a conflict, in which a treatment recommendation that could cost more lives than the disease itself was supported by statistics from only one randomised controlled study. Additionally, poor outcomes and dissenting opinion appear to have been obscured. This recommendation may have been made in a true spirit of unbiased scientific inquiry, but the appearance of dispassionate analysis was eroded by large donations from a drug company to the organisation making the recommendation and payments for research and lecture fees to its individual expert panellists. \#\#\#\# Summary points The American Heart Association rated the thrombolytic agent alteplase (tPA) as a class I (definitely recommended) intervention for stroke despite controversy about its safety and efficacy Most of the association's stroke experts have ties to the manufacturers of \ldots{}  Correspondence to: Dr Starkman},

The incidence of GBS can therefore increase during outbreaks of infectious diseases, as was seen during the Zika virus epidemics in 2013 in French Polynesia and 2015 in Latin America. Diagnosis and management of GBS can be complicated as its clinical presentation and disease course are heterogeneous, and no international clinical guidelines are currently available. To support clinicians, especially in the context of an outbreak{$\mkern1mu$}, we have developed a globally applicable guideline for the diagnosis and management of GBS. The guideline is based on current literature and expert consensus, and has a ten-step structure to facilitate its use in clinical practice. We first provide an introduction to the diagnostic criteria, clinical variants and differential diagnoses of GBS. The ten steps then cover early recognition and diagnosis of GBS, admission to the intensive care unit, treatment indication and selection, monitoring and treatment of disease progression, prediction of clinical course and outcome, and management of complications and sequelae.},

Favorable outcome (assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale) occurred in 53.9\% of Hunt and Hess Grade IV, and 24.1\% of Grade V patients. Outcome was largely determined by the initial hemorrhage and subsequent development of intractable intracranial hypertension or cerebral infarction. Using multivariate analysis, the authors developed three models to predict outcome. It was found that predicting outcome based only on clinical and diagnostic criteria present at admission may have resulted in withholding treatment from 30\% of the patients who subsequently experienced favorable outcomes. It is concluded that aggressive management including surgical aneurysm obliteration can benefit patients with poor neurological grades and should not be denied solely on the basis of the neurological condition on admission.},

Despite the mortality benefits of lung protective ventilation, adherence rates to evidence-based ventilator practice have remained low and ARDS mortality has remained high.                                            Objective                Determine variation in ARDS mortality and adherence to low tidal volume ventilation (LTV) across US hospitals.                                            Materials and Methods                We identified mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS using data from Philips eICU (2014-2015). We then used multi-variable hierarchical logistic regression models with hospital site as the random effect and patient and hospital level factors as fixed effects to assess the hospital risk adjusted mortality rate and median odds ratio for the association between mortality and hospital site. We then assessed associations between adherence to LTV (defined as 4-8\hspace{0.25em}mL/kg PBW) and hospital risk adjusted mortality rates using Spearman correlation.                                            Results                Among 4441 patients admitted at 110 hospitals with ARDS, the hospital risk-adjusted mortality rate ranged from 19\% to 39\%, and the MOR for hospital of admission was 1.33 (95\% CI 1.25-1.41). Among 3070 patients at 72 hospitals with available ventilator data, 73\% of patients had a median set Vt between 4 to 8\hspace{0.25em}mL/kg PBW; hospital adherence rates to LTV ranged from 13\% to 95\%. There was no association between hospital adherence to LTV and risk-adjusted mortality rate (spearman correlation coefficient -0.01, p\,=\,.93). Similarly, among 956 patients who started with a Vt {$>$} 8\hspace{0.25em}mL/kg PBW, there was no association between the percent of patients at each hospital whose Vt was decreased to {$\leq$} 8\hspace{0.25em}mL/kg PBW and risk adjusted mortality rate (spearman correlation coefficient .05, p\,=\,.73).                                            Conclusion                Risk adjusted mortality and use of LTV for patients with ARDS varied widely across hospitals. However, hospital adherence to LTV was not associated with ARDS mortality rates. Further evaluation of hospital practices associated with lower ARDS mortality are warranted.},

A well-defined descriptive question aims to quantify and characterize some feature of the health of a population and must clearly state: 1) the target population, characterized by person and place, and anchored in time; 2) the outcome, event, or health state or characteristic; and 3) the measure of occurrence that will be used to summarize the outcome (e.g., incidence, prevalence, average time to event, etc.). Additionally, 4) any auxiliary variables will be prespecified and their roles as stratification factors (to characterize the outcome distribution) or nuisance variables (to be standardized over) will be stated. We illustrate application of this framework to describe the prevalence of viral suppression on December 31, 2019, among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had been linked to HIV care in the United States. Application of this framework highlights biases that may arise from missing data, especially 1) differences between the target population and the analytical sample; 2) measurement error; 3) competing events, late entries, loss to follow-up, and inappropriate interpretation of the chosen measure of outcome occurrence; and 4) inappropriate adjustment.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Delaying time to prone positioning (PP) may be associated with higher mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We evaluated the use and the impact of early PP on clinical outcomes in intubated patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) for COVID-19. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} All intubated patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 were involved in a secondary analysis from a prospective multicenter cohort study of COVID-ICU network including 149 ICUs across France, Belgium and Switzerland. Patients were followed-up until Day-90. The primary outcome was survival at Day-60. Analysis used a Cox proportional hazard model including a propensity score. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Among 2137 intubated patients, 1504 (70.4\%) were placed in PP during their ICU stay and 491 (23\%) during the first 24 h following ICU admission. One hundred and eighty-one patients (36.9\%) of the early PP group had a \-PaO2/FiO2 ratio\,{$>$}\,150 mmHg when prone positioning was initiated. Among non-early PP group patients, 1013 (47.4\%) patients had finally been placed in PP within a median delay of 3 days after ICU admission. Day-60 mortality in nonearly PP group was 34.2\% versus 39.3\% in the early PP group (p\,=\,0.038). Day-28 and Day-90 mortality as well as the need for adjunctive therapies was more important in patients with early PP. After propensity score adjustment, no significant difference in survival at Day-60 was found between the two study groups (HR 1.34 [0.96\textendash 1.68], p\,=\,0.09 and HR 1.19 [0.998\textendash 1.412], p\,=\,0.053 in complete case analysis or in multiple imputation analysis, respectively). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} In a large multicentric international cohort of intubated ICU patients with ARDS due to COVID-19, PP has been used frequently as a main treatment. In this study, our data failed to show a survival benefit associated with early PP started within 24 h after ICU admission compared to PP after day-1 for all COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation regardless of their severity.},

  abstract = {Objective: New, value-based regulations and reimbursement structures are creating historic care management challenges, thinning the margins and threatening the viability of hospitals and health systems. The Society of Critical Care Medicine convened a taskforce of Academic Leaders in Critical Care Medicine on February 22, 2016, during the 45th Critical Care Congress to develop a toolkit drawing on the experience of successful leaders of critical care organizations in North America for advancing critical care organizations (Appendix 1). The goal of this article was to provide a roadmap and call attention to key factors that adult critical care medicine leadership in both academic and nonacademic setting should consider when planning for value-based care. Design: Relevant medical literature was accessed through a literature search. Material published by federal health agencies and other specialty organizations was also reviewed. Collaboratively and iteratively, taskforce members corresponded by electronic mail and held monthly conference calls to finalize this report. Setting: The business and value\&sol;performance critical care organization building section comprised of leaders of critical care organizations with expertise in critical care administration, healthcare management, and clinical practice. Measurements and Main Results: Two phases of critical care organizations care integration are described: ``horizontal,'' within the system and regionalization of care as an initial phase, and ``vertical,'' with a post-ICU and postacute care continuum as a succeeding phase. The tools required for the clinical and financial transformation are provided, including the essential prerequisites of forming a critical care organization; the manner in which a critical care organization can help manage transformational domains is considered. Lastly, how to achieve organizational health system support for critical care organization implementation is discussed. Conclusions: A critical care organization that incorporates functional clinical horizontal and vertical integration for ICU patients and survivors, aligns strategy and operations with those of the parent health system, and encompasses knowledge on finance and risk will be better positioned to succeed in the value-based world.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether early use of moderate hypothermia (33-34 \textdegree C) compared with strict normothermia (36-37 \textdegree C) improves mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock receiving venoarterial ECMO. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial of patients (who were eligible if they had been endotracheally intubated and were receiving venoarterial ECMO for cardiogenic shock for {$<$}6 hours) conducted in the intensive care units at 20 French cardiac shock care centers between October 2016 and July 2019. Of 786 eligible patients, 374 were randomized. Final follow-up occurred in November 2019. INTERVENTIONS Early moderate hypothermia (33-34 \textdegree C; n = 168) for 24 hours or strict normothermia (36-37 \textdegree C; n = 166). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was mortality at 30 days. There were 31 secondary outcomes including mortality at days 7, 60, and 180; a composite outcome of death, heart transplant, escalation to left ventricular assist device implantation, or stroke at days 30, 60, and 180; and days without requiring a ventilator or kidney replacement therapy at days 30, 60, and 180. Adverse events included rates of severe bleeding, sepsis, and number of units of packed red blood cells transfused during venoarterial ECMO. RESULTS Among the 374 patients who were randomized, 334 completed the trial (mean age, 58 [SD, 12] years; 24\% women) and were included in the primary analysis. At 30 days, 71 patients (42\%) in the moderate hypothermia group had died vs 84 patients (51\%) in the normothermia group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.71 [95\% CI, 0.45 to 1.13], P = .15; risk difference, -8.3\% [95\% CI, -16.3\% to -0.3\%]). For the composite outcome of death, heart transplant, escalation to left ventricular assist device implantation, or stroke at day 30, the adjusted odds ratio was 0.61 (95\% CI, 0.39 to 0.96; P = .03) for the moderate hypothermia group compared with the normothermia group and the risk difference was -11.5\% (95\% CI, -23.2\% to 0.2\%). Of the 31 secondary outcomes, 30 were inconclusive. The incidence of moderate or severe bleeding was 41\% in the moderate hypothermia group vs 42\% in the normothermia group. The incidence of infections was 52\% in both groups. The incidence of bacteremia was 20\% in the moderate hypothermia group vs 30\% in the normothermia group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial involving patients with refractory cardiogenic shock treated with venoarterial ECMO, early application of moderate hypothermia for 24 hours did not significantly increase survival compared with normothermia. However, because the 95\% CI was wide and included a potentially important effect size, these findings should be considered inconclusive.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with depression who are treated in primary care practices may receive antidepressants for prolonged periods. Data are limited on the effects of maintaining or discontinuing antidepressant therapy in this setting. METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial involving adults who were being treated in 150 general practices in the United Kingdom. All the patients had a history of at least two depressive episodes or had been taking antidepressants for 2 years or longer and felt well enough to consider stopping antidepressants. Patients who had received citalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, or mirtazapine were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to maintain their current antidepressant therapy (maintenance group) or to taper and discontinue such therapy with the use of matching placebo (discontinuation group). The primary outcome was the first relapse of depression during the 52-week trial period, as evaluated in a time-toevent analysis. Secondary outcomes were depressive and anxiety symptoms, physical and withdrawal symptoms, quality of life, time to stopping an antidepressant or placebo, and global mood ratings. RESULTS A total of 1466 patients underwent screening. Of these patients, 478 were enrolled in the trial (238 in the maintenance group and 240 in the discontinuation group). The average age of the patients was 54 years; 73\% were women. Adherence to the trial assignment was 70\% in the maintenance group and 52\% in the discontinuation group. By 52 weeks, relapse occurred in 92 of 238 patients (39\%) in the maintenance group and in 135 of 240 (56\%) in the discontinuation group (hazard ratio, 2.06; 95\% confidence interval, 1.56 to 2.70; P{$<$}0.001).

We present new evidence that analyzing ordinal data as metric is problematic. We demonstrate that treating ordinal data as metric can yield low correct detection rates, distorted effect size estimates, and greatly inflated false alarm rates. Moreover, we demonstrate that the averaging of multiple ordinal items into a Likert scale does not solve these problems. We provide examples of real data in the contexts of the difference of two groups and simple linear regression. To solve these problems we use an ordered probit model with Bayesian estimation of parameters. The ordered probit model shows appropriate correct detection rates and false alarm rates, and produces accurate effect sizes estimates and response probabilities. Bayesian estimation of this ordinal model is straight forward, yields rich and accurate information, and has no need for auxiliary sampling assumptions. We conclude that ordinal data ought to be analyzed with ordinal models, and that Bayesian estimation is an excellent method for accomplishing that goal.},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems \textemdash{} false alarms, misses, and inversions \textemdash{} for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

Outcomes that can only be ascertained in live-born children will be missing for those who do not survive till birth. In this article, we illustrate a common bias structure (leading to `live-birth bias') that arises from studying the effects of prenatal exposure to environmental factors on long-term health outcomes among live births only in pregnancy cohorts. To illustrate this we used prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in school-aged children as an example. PFAS are persistent organic pollutants that may impact human fecundity and be toxic for neurodevelopment. We simulated several hypothetical scenarios based on characteristics from the Danish National Birth Cohort and found that a weak inverse association may appear even if PFAS do not cause ADHD but have a considerable effect on fetal survival. The magnitude of the negative bias was generally small, and adjusting for common causes of the outcome and fetal loss can reduce the bias. Our example highlights the need to identify the determinants of pregnancy loss and the importance of quantifying bias arising from conditioning on live birth in observational studies.},

Quantifying the impact of such delays to concordant treatment is important for decision-making about interventions to reduce the delays and for quantifying the burden of disease due to antimicrobial resistance. There are, however, potentially important biases to be addressed, including immortal time bias. We aimed to estimate the impact of delays in appropriate antibiotic treatment of patients with Acinetobacter species hospital-acquired bacteremia in Thailand on 30-day mortality by emulating a target trial using retrospective cohort data from Sunpasitthiprasong Hospital in 2003\textendash 2015. For each day, we defined treatment as concordant if the isolated organism was susceptible to at least 1 antibiotic given. Among 1,203 patients with Acinetobacter species hospital-acquired bacteremia, 682 had 1 or more days of delays to concordant treatment. Surprisingly, crude 30-day mortality was lower in patients with delays of {$\geq$}3 days compared with those who had 1\textendash 2 days of delays. Accounting for confounders and immortal time bias resolved this paradox. Emulating a target trial, we found that these delays were associated with an absolute increase in expected 30-day mortality of 6.6\% (95\% confidence interval: 0.2, 13.0), from 33.8\% to 40.4\%.},

Whether the increase in postvaccination infections during the summer of 2021 was caused by declining immunity over time, the emergence of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant, or both is unknown. METHODS We extracted data regarding Covid-19\textendash related vaccination and outcomes during a 9-month period (December 11, 2020, to September 8, 2021) for approximately 10.6 million North Carolina residents by linking data from the North Carolina Covid-19 Surveillance System and the Covid-19 Vaccine Management System. We used a Cox regression model to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer\textendash BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson \& Johnson\textendash Janssen) vaccines in reducing the current risks of Covid-19, hospitalization, and death, as a function of time elapsed since vaccination. RESULTS For the two-dose regimens of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines BNT162b2 (30 {$\mu$}g per dose) and mRNA-1273 (100 {$\mu$}g per dose), vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 was 94.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 94.1 to 94.9) and 95.9\% (95\% CI, 95.5 to 96.2), respectively, at 2 months after the first dose and decreased to 66.6\% (95\% CI, 65.2 to 67.8) and 80.3\% (95\% CI, 79.3 to 81.2), respectively, at 7 months. Among early recipients of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, effectiveness decreased by approximately 15 and 10 percentage points, respectively, from mid-June to mid-July, when the delta variant became dominant. For the one-dose regimen of Ad26.COV2.S (5\,\texttimes\,1010 viral particles), effectiveness against Covid-19 was 74.8\% (95\% CI, 72.5 to 76.9) at 1 month and decreased to 59.4\% (95\% CI, 57.2 to 61.5) at 5 months. All three vaccines maintained better effectiveness in preventing hospitalization and death than in preventing infection over time, although the two mRNA vaccines provided higher levels of protection than Ad26.COV2.S.

  abstract = {Background: Free, open access meducation (FOAM) refers to open access, online learning resources in medicine. It includes all formats of digital products including blogs and podcasts. The number of FOAM blog and podcast sites in emergency medicine and critical care increased dramatically from 2002 to 2013, and physicians began to rely on the availability of these resources. The current landscape of these FOAM sites is unknown. Objective: This study aimed to (1) estimate the current number of active, open access blogs and podcasts in emergency medicine and critical care, and (2) describe observed and anticipated trends in the FOAM movement using Christensen's Theory of Disruptive Innovation as a theoretical framework. Methods: The authors used multiple resources and sampling strategies to identify active, open-access blogs and podcasts between April 25-May 8, 2022, and classified these websites as blogs, podcasts, or blogs+podcasts. For each category, they reported the following outcome measures using descriptive statistics: age, funding, affiliations, and team composition. Based on these findings, the authors projected trends in the number of active sites using a positivist paradigm and Christensen's Theory of Disruptive Innovation as a theoretical framework. Results: The authors identified 109 emergency medicine and critical care websites, comprised of 50 blogs, 25 podcasts, and 34 blogs+podcasts. Ages ranged from 0 to 18 years; 27.5\% sold products, 18.3\% used advertisements, 44\% had institutional funding, and 27.5\% had no affiliation or external funding sources. Team sizes ranged from 1 (23.9\%) to ?5 (55\%) individuals. Conclusions: There was a sharp decline in the number of emergency medicine and critical care blogs and podcasts in the last decade, dropping 40.4\% since 2013. The initial growth of FOAM and its subsequent downturn align with principles in Christensen's Theory of Disruptive Innovation. These findings have important implications for the field of medical education.},

Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and randomization (for population studies) should, if applied properly, eliminate most such noncausal associations. We argue, however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of biologic laboratory experiments\textemdash the use of ``negative controls''\textemdash is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic flaws. We distinguish 2 types of negative controls (exposure controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to specify the conditions under which negative controls will be sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational studies.},

Right-sided LHI had higher incidence rates of malignant brain edema (MBE) (48.5 vs. 30.8\%, p = 0.001) and a composite of cardiovascular events (29.8 vs. 17.5\%, p = 0.011) during hospitalization. The incidence rate of 1-month mortality (34.5 vs. 23.8\%, p = 0.036) was higher in right-sided patients with LHI, but there were no hemispheric differences in the incidence rates of 3-month mortality and unfavorable outcome (both p {$>$} 0.05). Multivariate analyses suggested right hemisphere involvement was independently associated with increased risk of MBE (adjusted OR 2.37, 95\% CI 1.26\textendash 4.43, p = 0.007) and composite of cardiovascular events (adjusted OR 2.04, 95\% CI 1.12\textendash 3.72, p = 0.020). However, it was not independently associated with 1-month death, 3-month mortality, and 3-month unfavorable outcome (all p {$>$} 0.05)., Conclusions: Right-sided patients with LHI had higher frequency of atrial fibrillation and cardio-embolism than the left-sided patients. Right hemisphere involvement was independently associated with increased risk of MBE and composite of cardiovascular events during hospitalization, whereas stroke lateralization was not an independent predictor of mortality and unfavorable outcome in patients with LHI.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes by antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens among men with HIV. DESIGN: We included men with HIV on ART in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study who, between February 2020 and October 2021, were 18{$\mkern1mu$}years or older and had adequate virological control, CD4 + cell count, and HIV viral load measured in the previous 12{$\mkern1mu$}months, and no previous COVID-19 diagnosis or vaccination. METHODS: We compared the adjusted risks of documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, COVID-19-related hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission by baseline ART regimen: tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/FTC, abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC), and other. We fit pooled logistic regressions to estimate the 18-month risks standardized by demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: Among 20 494 eligible individuals, the baseline characteristics were similar across regimens, except that TDF/FTC and TAF/FTC had lower prevalences of chronic kidney disease and estimated glomerular filtration rate {$<$}60{$\mkern1mu$}ml/min. Compared with TAF/FTC, the estimated 18-month risk ratio (95\% confidence interval) of documented SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.65 (0.43, 0.89) for TDF/FTC, 1.00 (0.85, 1.18) for ABC/3TC, and 0.87 (0.70, 1.04) for others. The corresponding risk ratios for COVID-19 hospitalization were 0.43 (0.07, 0.87), 1.09 (0.79, 1.48), and 1.21 (0.88, 1.62). The risk of COVID-19 ICU admission was lowest for TDF/FTC, but the estimates were imprecise. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that, in men living with HIV, TDF/FTC may protect against COVID-19-related events. Randomized trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness of TDF as prophylaxis for, and early treatment of, COVID-19 in the general population.},

This study simulated trials typical of those stopping early for benefit in the real world and estimated the degree to which early stopping likely overestimates benefit. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} From 1 million simulated trials, we selected those trials that exceeded interim stopping criteria, and compared apparent benefit when stopped with the true benefit used to generate the data. Each simulation randomly assigned period of observation, number of subjects, and control event rate using normal distributions centred on the same parameters in a template trial typical of real-world ``truncated'' (i.e. stopped for benefit) trials. The intervention's true relative risk reduction (RRR) was also randomized, and assumed 1\% of drugs have a warfarin-like effect (60\% RRR), 5\% a statin-like effect (35\% RRR), 39\% an ASA-like effect (15\% RRR), 50\% no effect (0\% RRR), and that 5\% would cause harm (modelled as a 20\% relative risk increase). Trials had a single interim analysis and a z-value for stopping of 2.782 (O'Brien-Fleming threshold). We also modelled (1) a large truncated trial based on the SPRINT blood pressure trial (using SPRINT's parameters and stopping criteria) and (2) the same typical truncated trials if they instead went to completion as planned with no interim analysis. Results:\hspace{0.6em} For typical truncated trials, the true RRR was roughly 2/3 the observed RRR at the time of stopping. RRR was overestimated by an absolute 14.9\% (median, IQR 6.4\textendash 24.6) in typical truncated trials, by 5.3\% (IQR -0.1 to 11.4) in the same trials if instead carried to completion, and by 2.3\% (IQR 0.98\textendash 1.09) in large SPRINT-like trials. For all models, to keep the absolute RRR overestimate below 5\%, 250 events were required. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Simulated trials typical of those stopping early for benefit overestimate the true relative risk reduction by roughly 50\% (i.e. the true RRR was 2/3 of the observed value). Overestimation was much smaller, and likely unimportant, when simulating large SPRINT-like trials stopping early. Whether trials were large or small, stopped early or not, a minimum 250 events were needed to avoid overestimating relative risk reduction by an absolute 5\% or more.},

  abstract = {Background Tenecteplase is a newer thrombolytic agent with some pharmacological advantages over alteplase. Previous phase 2 trials of tenecteplase in acute ischaemic stroke have shown promising results. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase versus alteplase in patients with acute stroke who were eligible for intravenous thrombolysis. Methods This phase 3, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint, superiority trial was done in 13 stroke units in Norway. We enrolled adults with suspected acute ischaemic stroke who were eligible for thrombolysis and admitted within 4{$\cdot$}5 h of symptom onset or within 4{$\cdot$}5 h of awakening with symptoms, or who were eligible for bridging therapy before thrombectomy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous tenecteplase 0{$\cdot$}4 mg/kg (to a maximum of 40 mg) or alteplase 0{$\cdot$}9 mg/kg (to a maximum of 90 mg), via a block randomisation schedule stratified by centre of inclusion. Patients were not informed of treatment allocation; treating physicians were aware of treatment allocation but those assessing the primary and secondary endpoints were not. The primary outcome was excellent functional outcome defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0\textendash 1 at 3 months. The primary analysis was an unadjusted and non-stratified intention-to-treat analysis with last observation carried forward for imputation of missing data. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01949948. Findings Between Sept 1, 2012, and Sept 30, 2016, 1107 patients met the inclusion criteria and seven patients were excluded because informed consent was withdrawn or eligibility for thrombolytic treatment was reconsidered. 1100 patients were randomly assigned to the tenecteplase (n=549) or alteplase (n=551) groups. The median age of participants was 77 years (IQR 64\textendash 79) and the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at baseline was 4 points (IQR 2\textendash 8). A final diagnosis other than ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack was found in 99 (18\%) patients in the tenecteplase group and 91 (17\%) patients in the alteplase group. The primary outcome was achieved by 354 (64\%) patients in the tenecteplase group and 345 (63\%) patients in the alteplase group (odds ratio 1{$\cdot$}08, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}84\textendash 1{$\cdot$}38; p=0{$\cdot$}52). By 3 months, 29 (5\%) patients had died in the tenecteplase group compared with 26 (5\%) in the alteplase group. The frequency of serious adverse events was similar between groups (145 [26\%] in the tenecteplase group vs 141 [26\%] in the alteplase group; p=0{$\cdot$}74). Interpretation Tenecteplase was not superior to alteplase and showed a similar safety profile. Most patients enrolled in this study had mild stroke. Further trials are needed to establish the safety and efficacy in patients with severe stroke and whether tenecteplase is non-inferior to alteplase. Funding Research Council of Norway.},

  abstract = {Balanced crystalloids may improve outcomes compared with saline for some critically ill adults. Lower tonicity of balanced crystalloids could worsen cerebral edema in patients with intracranial pathology. The effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on clinical outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) requires further study. We planned an a priori subgroup analysis of TBI patients enrolled in the pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02444988, NCT02547779). Primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital discharge disposition (home, facility, death). Regression models adjusted for pre-specified baseline covariates compared outcomes. TBI patients assigned to balanced crystalloids (n\,=\,588) and saline (n\,=\,569) had similar baseline characteristics including Injury Severity Score 19 (10); mean maximum head/neck Abbreviated Injury Score, 3.4 (1.0). Isotonic crystalloid volume administered between intensive care unit admission and first of hospital discharge or 30 days was 2037 (3470) mL and 1723 (2923) mL in the balanced crystalloids and saline groups, respectively (p\,=\,0.18). During the study period, 94 (16\%) and 82 (14\%) patients (16\%) died in the balanced crystalloid and saline groups, respectively (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.03; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 1.75; p\,=\,0.913). Patients in the balanced crystalloid group were more likely to die or be discharged to another medical facility (aOR 1.38 [1.02-1.86]; p\,=\,0.04). Overall, balanced crystalloids were associated with worse discharge disposition in critically injured patients with TBI compared with saline. The confidence intervals cannot exclude a clinically relevant increase in mortality when balanced crystalloids are used for patients with TBI.},

Data sources~Medline, PreMedline, Embase, and The Cochrane Library.Eligibility criteria for selecting studies~Published randomised trials evaluating the use of a DOAC, vitamin K antagonist, or antiplatelet drug for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.Results~23 randomised trials involving 94\,656 patients were analysed: 13 compared a DOAC with warfarin dosed to achieve a target INR of 2.0-3.0. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily (odds ratio 0.79, 95\% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.94), dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (0.65, 0.52 to 0.81), edoxaban 60 mg once daily (0.86, 0.74 to 1.01), and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (0.88, 0.74 to 1.03) reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism compared with warfarin. The risk of stroke or systemic embolism was higher with edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.33, 1.02 to 1.75) and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (1.35, 1.03 to 1.78) than with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. The risk of all-cause mortality was lower with all DOACs than with warfarin. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily (0.71, 0.61 to 0.81), dabigatran 110 mg twice daily (0.80, 0.69 to 0.93), edoxaban 30 mg once daily (0.46, 0.40 to 0.54), and edoxaban 60 mg once daily (0.78, 0.69 to 0.90) reduced the risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin. The risk of major bleeding was higher with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily than apixaban 5 mg twice daily (1.33, 1.09 to 1.62), rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily than apixaban 5 mg twice daily (1.45, 1.19 to 1.78), and rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily than edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.31, 1.07 to 1.59). The risk of intracranial bleeding was substantially lower for most DOACs compared with warfarin, whereas the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was higher with some DOACs than warfarin. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily was ranked the highest for most outcomes, and was cost effective compared with warfarin.Conclusions~The network meta-analysis informs the choice of DOACs for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Several DOACs are of net benefit compared with warfarin. A trial directly comparing DOACs would overcome the need for indirect comparisons to be made through network meta-analysis.Systematic review registration~PROSPERO CRD 42013005324.},

Whether to pursue this life-sustaining treatment typically hinges on intense conversations between family and clinicians. The aim of this study was, among a cohort of patient who had undergone tracheostomy after SABI, to explore the long-term reflections of patients and their families as they look back on this decision. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} For this qualitative study, we reviewed the electronic medical records of patients with SABI who underwent tracheostomy. We included all patients who were admitted to our 30-bed neuro-intensive care unit with SABI and underwent tracheostomy between November 2017 and October 2019. Using purposive sampling, we invited survivors and family members to participate in telephone interviews greater than 3 months after SABI until thematic saturation was reached. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed by using thematic analysis. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Overall, 38 patients with SABI in the neuro-intensive care unit underwent tracheostomy. The mean age of patients was 49 (range 18\textendash 81), with 19 of 38 patients diagnosed with traumatic brain injury and 19 of 38 with stroke. We interviewed 20 family members of 18 of 38 patients at a mean of 16 (SD 9) months after hospitalization. The mean patient age among those with an interview was 50 (range 18\textendash 76); the mean modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) was 4.7 (SD 0.8) at hospital discharge. At the time of the interview, ten patients lived at home and two in a skilled nursing facility and had a mean mRS of 2.6 (SD 0.9), and six had died. As families reflected on the decision to proceed with a tracheostomy, two themes emerged. First, families did not remember tracheostomy as a choice because the uncertain chance of recovery rendered the certain alternative of death unacceptable or because they valued survival above all and therefore could not perceive an alternative to life-sustaining treatment. Second, families identified a fundamental need to receive supportive, consistent communication centering around compassion, clarity, and hope. When this need was met, families were able to reflect on the tracheostomy decision with peace, regardless of their loved one's eventual outcome. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} After SABI, prognostic uncertainty almost transcends the concept of choice. Families who proceeded with a tracheostomy saw it as the only option at the time. High-quality communication may mitigate the stress surrounding this high-stakes decision.},

  abstract = {Selection bias remains a subject of controversy. Existing definitions of selection bias are ambiguous. To improve communication and the conduct of epidemiologic research focused on estimating causal effects, we propose to unify the various existing definitions of selection bias in the literature by considering any bias away from the true causal effect in the referent population (the population before the selection process), due to selecting the sample from the referent population, as selection bias. Given this unified definition, selection bias can be further categorized into two broad types: type 1 selection bias owing to restricting to one or more level(s) of a collider (or a descendant of a collider) and type 2 selection bias owing to restricting to one or more level(s) of an effect measure modifier. To aid in explaining these two types\textemdash which can co-occur\textemdash we start by reviewing the concepts of the target population, the study sample, and the analytic sample. Then, we illustrate both types of selection bias using causal diagrams. In addition, we explore the differences between these two types of selection bias, and describe methods to minimize selection bias. Finally, we use an example of ``M-bias'' to demonstrate the advantage of classifying selection bias into these two types.},

The purpose of this predefined secondary analysis was to identify if any effects of fluoxetine were maintained or delayed over 12 months. METHODS: EFFECTS was an investigator-led, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial in Sweden that enrolled adult patients with stroke. Patients were randomized to 20 mg oral fluoxetine or matching placebo for 6 months and followed for another 6 months. The primary outcome was functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale), at 6 months. Predefined secondary outcomes for these analyses included the modified Rankin Scale, health status, quality of life, fatigue, mood, and depression at 12 months. RESULTS: One thousand five hundred patients were recruited from 35 centers in Sweden between 2014 and 2019; 750 were allocated fluoxetine and 750 placebo. At 12 months, modified Rankin Scale data were available in 715 (95\%) patients allocated fluoxetine and 712 (95\%) placebo. The distribution of modified Rankin Scale categories was similar in the 2 groups (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.92 [95\% CI, 0.76\textendash 1.10]). Patients allocated fluoxetine scored worse on memory with a median value of 89 (interquartile range, 75\textendash 100) versus 93 (interquartile range, 82\textendash 100); P=0.0021 and communication 93 (interquartile range, 82\textendash 100) versus 96 (interquartile range, 86\textendash 100); P=0.024 domains of the Stroke Impact Scale compared with placebo. There were no other differences in secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoxetine after acute stroke had no effect on functional outcome at 12 months. Patients allocated fluoxetine scored worse on memory and communication on the Stroke Impact Scale compared with placebo, but this is likely to be due to chance.},

We sought to determine the annual US incidence, 5-year survival, and number of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-recommended regimens for indications described in the literature as an "unmet medical need." We queried Google Scholar to identify publications where authors used the phrase "unmet medical need" to refer to a specific cancer indication. For each indication, we investigated the annual US incidence, 5-year survival, and number of NCCN recommended regimens. We identified 237 cancer indications considered by authors an "unmet medical need." The term was found most frequently appended to breast cancer indications comprising 30 of the 237 citations (12.7\%). This was followed by lung 24/237 (10.1\%), hepatocellular 18/237 (7.6\%), and prostate cancer 13/237 (5.4\%). In 55 of 237 (23.2\%) instances where an indication was described by the authors as an unmet medical need, the incidence was 1,000 cases per year, there were five regimens recommended by NCCN, and there was a 50\% or greater 5-year survival. Forty-three of 237 (18.1\%) indications had at least an incidence of 10,000 cases a year, 10 recommended regimens, and a 50\% 5-year survival. In conclusion, "unmet medical need" has been used to describe cancer indications that are rare, and have few options and poor survival outcomes. However, the term has also been used to describe indications that occur commonly, have many treatment alternatives, and are clinically indolent with more encouraging expectations for survival. Some standardization is needed.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To determine whether uninsured critically ill patients had differences in 30-day mortality and critical care service use compared with those with private insurance and to determine if outcome variability could be attributed to patient-level or hospital-level effects. Methods: Retrospective cohort study using Pennsylvania hospital discharge data with detailed clinical risk adjustment, from fiscal years 2005 and 2006, consisting of 167 general acute care hospitals, with 138,720 critically ill adult patients 64 years of age or younger. Measurements and Main Results: Measurements were 30-day mortality and receipt of five critical care procedures. Uninsured patients had an absolute 30-day mortality of 5.7\%, compared with 4.6\% for those with private insurance and 6.4\% for those with Medicaid. Increased 30-day mortality among uninsured patients persisted after adjustment for patient characteristics (odds ratio [OR], 1.25 for uninsured vs. insured; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.04\textendash 1.50) and hospital-level effects (OR, 1.26; 95\% CI, 1.05\textendash 1.51). Compared with insured patients, uninsured patients had decreased risk-adjusted odds of receiving a central venous catheter (OR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.72\textendash 0.97), acute hemodialysis (OR, 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.39\textendash 0.91), and tracheostomy (OR, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.29\textendash 0.64). Conclusions: Lack of health insurance is associated with increased 30-day mortality and decreased use of common procedures for the critically ill in Pennsylvania. Differences were not attributable to hospital-level effects, suggesting that the uninsured have a higher mortality and receive fewer procedures when compared with privately insured patients treated at the same hospitals.},

We investigated whether clazosentan reduced vasospasm-related morbidity and all-cause mortality. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned patients with aSAH secured by surgical clipping to clazosentan (5 mg/h, n=768) or placebo (n=389) for up to 14 days (27 countries, 102 sites, inpatient and outpatient settings) using an interactive web response system. The primary composite endpoint (week 6) included all-cause mortality, vasospasm-related new cerebral infarcts, delayed ischaemic neurological deficit due to vasospasm, and rescue therapy for vasospasm. The main secondary endpoint was dichotomised extended Glasgow outcome scale (GOSE; week 12). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00558311. Findings In the all-treated dataset, the primary endpoint was met in 161 (21\%) of 764 clazosentan-treated patients and 97 (25\%) of 383 placebo-treated patients (relative risk reduction 17\%, 95\% CI -4 to 33; p=0{$\cdot$}10). Poor functional outcome (GOSE score {$\leq$}4) occurred in 224 (29\%) clazosentan-treated patients and 95 (25\%) placebo-treated patients (-18\%, -45 to 4; p=0{$\cdot$}10). Lung complications, anaemia, and hypotension were more common with clazosentan. Mortality (week 12) was 6\% in both groups. Interpretation Clazosentan at 5 mg/h had no significant effect on mortality and vasospasm-related morbidity or functional outcome. Further investigation of patients undergoing endovascular coiling of ruptured aneurysms is needed to fully understand the potential usefulness of clazosentan in patients with aSAH.

When researchers are concerned about unknown confounders, plausible values for these bias parameters will be difficult to specify. Ding and VanderWeele developed bounding factor and E-value approaches that require the user to specify only some of the bias parameters. We describe the mathematical meaning of bounding factors and E-values and the plausibility of these methods in an applied context. We encourage researchers to pay particular attention to the assumption made, when using E-values, that the prevalence of the uncontrolled confounder among the exposed is 100\% (or, equivalently, the prevalence of the exposure among those without the confounder is 0\%). We contrast methods that attempt to bound biases or effects and alternative approaches such as quantitative bias analysis. We provide an example where failure to make this distinction led to erroneous statements. If the primary concern in an analysis is with known but unmeasured potential confounders, then E-values are not needed and may be misleading. In cases where the concern is with unknown confounders, the E-value assumption of an extreme possible prevalence of the confounder limits its practical utility.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To specify how (hypothetical) target trials would be designed to estimate the association between postoperative mortality of patients undergoing operations and a range of surgeon and hospital volume conditions and then to emulate these trials by using observational data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This observational data analysis emulated 4 hypothetical target trials of increasing complexity, ranging from a poorly defined trial that would randomly assign participants only to surgeon volume to one that would randomly assign participants to surgeon volume, hospital volume, and specific surgeon and hospital. This population-based cohort study included 9136 Medicare beneficiaries with a first diagnosis of pancreatic malignant neoplasm who did not require neoadjuvant therapy and underwent pancreatectomy between January 1, 2012, and September 30, 2016. Data analysis was performed between September 1, 2019, and October 8, 2021. EXPOSURES Number of pancreatectomies performed by surgeon and hospital during the prior year. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ninety-day mortality. RESULTS The analyses included 9136 Medicare beneficiaries treated by 1358 surgeons at 697 hospitals; median age was 73.3 years (IQR, 69.1-78.1 years), and 4642 were men (51\%). When trials with poorly defined interventions on surgeon volume were emulated, the estimated 90-day mortality was 7.9\% (95\% CI, 6.4\%-9.4\%) for lower-volume surgeons and 5.2\% (95\% CI, 2.7\%-10.9\%) for higher-volume surgeons. When trials with better-defined interventions were emulated, the difference was reduced: 7.8\% (95\% CI, 6.3\%-9.3\%) for lower-volume surgeons and 7.2\% (95\% CI, 6.0\%-8.7\%) for higher-volume surgeons. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study that emulated 4 different target trials with data from Medicare beneficiaries undergoing pancreatectomy, mortality differences across surgical volume levels were attenuated when the interventions were well defined. The application of the hypothetical target trial framework to this specific volume-outcomes scenario revealed the complexities of this research question and the unintentional biases introduced in prior studies, which emulated poorly defined trials whose results are therefore difficult to interpret.

METHODS To evaluate the early effectiveness of a fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine for the prevention of Covid-19\textendash related outcomes, we analyzed data recorded by the largest health care organization in Israel from January 3 to February 18, 2022. We evaluated the relative effectiveness of a fourth vaccine dose as compared with that of a third dose given at least 4 months earlier among persons 60 years of age or older. We compared outcomes in persons who had received a fourth dose with those in persons who had not, individually matching persons from these two groups with respect to multiple sociodemographic and clinical variables. A sensitivity analysis was performed with the use of parametric Poisson regression. RESULTS The primary analysis included 182,122 matched pairs. Relative vaccine effectiveness in days 7 to 30 after the fourth dose was estimated to be 45\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 47) against polymerase-chain-reaction\textendash confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection, 55\% (95\% CI, 53 to 58) against symptomatic Covid-19, 68\% (95\% CI, 59 to 74) against Covid-19\textendash related hospitalization, 62\% (95\% CI, 50 to 74) against severe Covid-19, and 74\% (95\% CI, 50 to 90) against Covid-19\textendash related death. The corresponding estimates in days 14 to 30 after the fourth dose were 52\% (95\% CI, 49 to 54), 61\% (95\% CI, 58 to 64), 72\% (95\% CI, 63 to 79), 64\% (95\% CI, 48 to 77), and 76\% (95\% CI, 48 to 91). In days 7 to 30 after a fourth vaccine dose, the difference in the absolute risk (three doses vs. four doses) was 180.1 cases per 100,000 persons (95\% CI, 142.8 to 211.9) for Covid-19\textendash related hospitalization and 68.8 cases per 100,000 persons (95\% CI, 48.5 to 91.9) for severe Covid-19. In sensitivity analyses, estimates of relative effectiveness against documented infection were similar to those in the primary analysis.

This review article focuses on the epidemiology, cause, mechanisms of injury, current treatment strategies, and future research directions of ICH. Incidence of hemorrhagic stroke has increased worldwide over the past 40 years, with shifts in the cause over time as hypertension management has improved and anticoagulant use has increased. Preclinical and clinical trials have elucidated the underlying ICH cause and mechanisms of injury from ICH including the complex interaction between edema, inflammation, iron-induced injury, and oxidative stress. Several trials have investigated optimal medical and surgical management of ICH without clear improvement in survival and functional outcomes. Ongoing research into novel approaches for ICH management provide hope for reducing the devastating effect of this disease in the future. Areas of promise in ICH therapy include prognostic biomarkers and primary prevention based on disease pathobiology, ultra-early hemostatic therapy, minimally invasive surgery, and perihematomal protection against inflammatory brain injury.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early rapid fluid resuscitation (boluses) in African children with severe febrile illnesses increases the 48-hour mortality by 3.3\% compared with controls (no bolus). We explored the effect of boluses on 48-hour all-cause mortality by clinical presentation at enrolment, hemodynamic changes over the first hour, and on different modes of death, according to terminal clinical events. We hypothesize that boluses may cause excess deaths from neurological or respiratory events relating to fluid overload. METHODS: Pre-defined presentation syndromes (PS; severe acidosis or severe shock, respiratory, neurological) and predominant terminal clinical events (cardiovascular collapse, respiratory, neurological) were described by randomized arm (bolus versus control) in 3,141 severely ill febrile children with shock enrolled in the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial. Landmark analyses were used to compare early mortality in treatment groups, conditional on changes in shock and hypoxia parameters. Competing risks methods were used to estimate cumulative incidence curves and sub-hazard ratios to compare treatment groups in terms of terminal clinical events. RESULTS: Of 2,396 out of 3,141 (76\%) classifiable participants, 1,647 (69\%) had a severe metabolic acidosis or severe shock PS, 625 (26\%) had a respiratory PS and 976 (41\%) had a neurological PS, either alone or in combination. Mortality was greatest among children fulfilling criteria for all three PS (28\% bolus, 21\% control) and lowest for lone respiratory (2\% bolus, 5\% control) or neurological (3\% bolus, 0\% control) presentations. Excess mortality in bolus arms versus control was apparent for all three PS, including all their component features. By one hour, shock had resolved (responders) more frequently in bolus versus control groups (43\% versus 32\%, P {$<$}0.001), but excess mortality with boluses was evident in responders (relative risk 1.98, 95\% confidence interval 0.94 to 4.17, P = 0.06) and 'non-responders' (relative risk 1.67, 95\% confidence interval 1.23 to 2.28, P = 0.001), with no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.68). The major difference between bolus and control arms was the higher proportion of cardiogenic or shock terminal clinical events in bolus arms (n = 123; 4.6\% versus 2.6\%, P = 0.008) rather than respiratory (n = 61; 2.2\% versus 1.3\%, P = 0.09) or neurological (n = 63, 2.1\% versus 1.8\%, P = 0.6) terminal clinical events. CONCLUSIONS: Excess mortality from boluses occurred in all subgroups of children. Contrary to expectation, cardiovascular collapse rather than fluid overload appeared to contribute most to excess deaths with rapid fluid resuscitation. These results should prompt a re-evaluation of evidence on fluid resuscitation for shock and a re-appraisal of the rate, composition and volume of resuscitation fluids.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine factors associated with variation in LTAC vs SNF transfer among hospitalized older adults. Supplemental content DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted this retrospective observational cohort study of hospitalized older adults (Ն65 years) transferred to an LTAC vs SNF during fiscal year 2012 using national 5\% Medicare data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Predictors of LTAC transfer were assessed using a multilevel mixed-effects model adjusting for patient-, hospital-, and region-level factors. We estimated variation partition coefficients and adjusted hospital- and region-specific LTAC transfer rates using sequential models. RESULTS Among 65 525 hospitalized older adults (42 461 [64.8\%] women; 39 908 [60.9\%] Ն85 years) transferred to an LTAC or SNF, 3093 (4.7\%) were transferred to an LTAC. We identified 29 patient-, 3 hospital-, and 5 region-level independent predictors. The strongest predictors of LTAC transfer were receiving a tracheostomy (adjusted odds ration [aOR], 23.8; 95\% CI, 15.8-35.9) and being hospitalized in close proximity to an LTAC (0-2 vs {$>$}42 miles; aOR, 8.4, 95\% CI, 6.1-11.5). After adjusting for case-mix, differences between patients explained 52.1\% (95\% CI, 47.7\%-56.5\%) of the variation in LTAC use. The remainder was attributable to hospital (15.0\%; 95\% CI, 12.3\%-17.6\%), and regional differences (32.9\%; 95\% CI, 27.6\%-38.3\%). Case-mix adjusted LTAC use was very high in the South (17\%-37\%) compared with the Pacific Northwest, North, and Northeast ({$<$}2.2\%). From the full multilevel model, the median adjusted hospital LTAC transfer rate was 2.1\% (10th-90th percentile, 0.24\%-10.8\%). Even within a region, adjusted hospital LTAC transfer rates varied substantially (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.26; 95\% CI, 0.23-0.30). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although many patient-level factors were associated with LTAC use, half of the variation in LTAC vs SNF transfer is independent of patients' illness severity or clinical complexity, and is explained by where the patient was hospitalized and in what region, with far greater use in the South. Even among hospitals in regions with similar LTAC access, there was considerable variation in LTAC use. Given the higher expense associated with LTACs vs SNFs, greater attention is needed to define the optimal role of LTACs in the postacute care of older adults.},

Patterns of care and outcomes at discharge and the 1-year follow-up in MCA aneurysm (MCAA) patients were analyzed and compared with those in a control group of patients with IAs in locations other than the MCA (non-MCAA patients). Independent predictors of a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score {$\leq$} 3) were identified, and their effect size was determined.                                         RESULTS               Among 1866 consecutive aSAH patients, 413 (22.1\%) harbored an MCAA. These MCAA patients presented with higher World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grades (p = 0.007), showed a higher rate of concomitant intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH; 41.9\% vs 16.7\%, p {$<$} 0.001), and experienced delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) more frequently (38.9\% vs 29.4\%, p = 0.001) than non-MCAA patients. After adjustment for confounders, patients with MCAA were as likely as non-MCAA patients to experience DCI (aOR 1.04, 95\% CI 0.74\textendash 1.45, p = 0.830). Surgical treatment was the dominant treatment modality in MCAA patients and at a significantly higher rate than in non-MCAA patients (81.7\% vs 36.7\%, p {$<$} 0.001). An MCAA location was a strong independent predictor of surgical treatment (aOR 8.49, 95\% CI 5.89\textendash 12.25, p {$<$} 0.001), despite statistical adjustment for variables traditionally associated with surgical treatment, such as (space-occupying) ICH (aOR 1.73, 95\% CI 1.23\textendash 2.45, p = 0.002). Even though MCAA patients were less likely to die during the acute hospitalization (aOR 0.52, 0.30\textendash 0.91, p = 0.022), their rate of a favorable outcome was lower at discharge than that in non-MCAA patients (55.7\% vs 63.7\%, p = 0.003). At the 1-year follow-up, 68.5\% and 69.6\% of MCAA and non-MCAA patients, respectively, had a favorable outcome (p = 0.676).                                         CONCLUSIONS               Microsurgical occlusion remains the predominant treatment choice for about 80\% of ruptured MCAAs in a European industrialized country. Although patients with MCAAs presented with worse admission grades and greater rates of concomitant ICH, in-hospital mortality was lower and long-term disability was comparable to those in patients with non-MCAA.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The global burden of sepsis is estimated as 15 to 19 million cases annually, with a mortality rate approaching 60\% in low-income countries. METHODS: In this retrospective before-after clinical study, we compared the outcome and clinical course of consecutive septic patients treated with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine during a 7-month period (treatment group) with a control group treated in our ICU during the preceding 7 months. The primary outcome was hospital survival. A propensity score was generated to adjust the primary outcome. RESULTS: There were 47 patients in both treatment and control groups, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. The hospital mortality was 8.5\% (4 of 47) in the treatment group compared with 40.4\% (19 of 47) in the control group (P {$<$} .001). The propensity adjusted odds of mortality in the patients treated with the vitamin C protocol was 0.13 (95\% CI, 0.04-0.48; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .002). The Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment score decreased in all patients in the treatment group, with none developing progressive organ failure. All patients in the treatment group were weaned off vasopressors, a mean of 18.3 \AE{} 9.8 h after starting treatment with the vitamin C protocol. The mean duration of vasopressor use was 54.9 \AE{} 28.4 h in the control group (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the early use of intravenous vitamin C, together with corticosteroids and thiamine, are effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, and in reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Additional studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings.},

  abstract = {Acquiring real-world evidence is crucial to support health policy, but observational studies are prone to serious biases. An approach was recently proposed to overcome confounding and immortal-time biases within the emulated trial framework. This tutorial provides a step-by-step description of the design and analysis of emulated trials, as well as R and Stata code, to facilitate its use in practice. The steps consist in: (i) specifying the target trial and inclusion criteria; (ii) cloning patients; (iii) defining censoring and survival times; (iv) estimating the weights to account for informative censoring introduced by design; and (v) analysing these data. These steps are illustrated with observational data to assess the benefit of surgery among 70\textendash 89-year-old patients diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer. Because of the severe unbalance of the patient characteristics between treatment arms (surgery yes/no), a na\"ive Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the initial cohort severely overestimated the benefit of surgery on 1-year survival (22\% difference), as did a survival analysis of the cloned dataset when informative censoring was ignored (17\% difference). By contrast, the estimated weights adequately removed the covariate imbalance. The weighted analysis still showed evidence of a benefit, though smaller (11\% difference), of surgery among older lung cancer patients on 1-year survival. Complementing the CERBOT tool, this tutorial explains how to proceed to conduct emulated trials using observational data in the presence of immortal-time bias. The strength of this approach is its transparency and its principles that are easily understandable by non-specialists.},

Other important findings relate to the predominance of cellular edema in TBI. Conclusions Significant new findings have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of brain edema; however, less progress has been made in treatment. Aquaporin water channels offer hope for modulating and abating the devastating effects of fulminating brain edema in trauma and stroke.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We evaluated whether stroke severity, functional outcome, and mortality are different in patients with ischemic stroke with or without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: A prospective, observational, multicentre cohort study in Catalonia, Spain. Recruitment was consecutive from midMarch to mid-May 2020. Patients had an acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours and a previous modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 3. We collected demographic data, vascular risk factors, prior mRS score, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, rate of reperfusion therapies, logistics, and metrics. Primary end point was functional outcome at 3 months. Favourable outcome was defined depending on the previous mRS score. Secondary outcome was mortality at 3 months. We performed mRS shift and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: We evaluated 701 patients (mean age 72.3{$\pm$}13.3 years, 60.5\% men) and 91 (13\%) had COVID-19 infection. Median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was higher in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19 (8 [3\textendash 18] versus 6 [2\textendash 14], P=0.049). Proportion of patients with a favourable functional outcome was 33.7\% in the COVID-19 and 47\% in the non-COVID-19 group. However, after a multivariable logistic regression analysis, COVID-19 infection did not increase the probability of unfavourable functional outcome. Mortality rate was 39.3\% among patients with COVID-19 and 16.1\% in the non-COVID-19 group. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, COVID-19 infection was a risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio, 3.14 [95\% CI, 2.10\textendash 4.71]; P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ischemic stroke and COVID-19 infection have more severe strokes and a higher mortality than patients with stroke without COVID-19 infection. However, functional outcome is comparable in both groups.},

  abstract = {Background: Delirium is an acute state of brain dysfunction characterised by fluctuating inattention and cognitive disturbances, usually due to illness. It occurs commonly in the intensive care unit (ICU), and it is associated with greater morbidity and mortality. It is likely that disturbances of sleep and of the day-night cycle play a significant role. Melatonin is a naturally occurring, safe and cheap hormone that can be administered to improve sleep. The main aim of this trial will be to determine whether prophylactic melatonin administered to critically ill adults, when compared with placebo, decreases the rate of delirium. Methods: This trial will be a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled study conducted in closed ICUs in Australia. Our aim is to enrol 850 adult patients with an expected ICU length of stay (LOS) of 72 h or more. Eligible patients for whom there is consent will be randomised to receive melatonin 4 mg enterally or placebo in a 1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated randomisation list, stratified by site. The study drug will be indistinguishable from placebo. Patients, doctors, nurses, investigators and statisticians will be blinded. Melatonin or placebo will be administered once per day at 21:00 until ICU discharge or 14 days after enrolment, whichever occurs first. Trained staff will assess patients twice daily to determine the presence or absence of delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU score. Data will also be collected on demographics, the overall prevalence of delirium, duration and severity of delirium, sleep quality, participation in physiotherapy sessions, ICU and hospital LOS, morbidity and mortality, and healthcare costs. A subgroup of 100 patients will undergo polysomnographic testing to further evaluate the quality of sleep. Discussion: Delirium is a significant issue in ICU because of its frequency and associated poorer outcomes. This trial will be the largest evaluation of melatonin as a prophylactic agent to prevent delirium in the critically ill population. This study will also provide one of the largest series of polysomnographic testing done in ICU.},

We created an initial list of frequently used drugs to search Pubmed/MEDLINE from 1966 to 2020 and reviewed phase III and IV data, case series, and drug authorities' safety warnings to assess a potential association with IS. Drugs were grouped according to the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System. Predefined criteria were applied to establish a level of evidence for an association, from A (high level of evidence of association) to E (high level of evidence of absence of association). In addition, we assessed relative risks and reviewed potential mechanisms of IS facilitation. We assessed 81 drugs or drug classes from 11 World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Groups. We identified a high level of association for erythropoietin, combined contraceptives, oral estrogen replacement therapy, bevacizumab, tamoxifen, and antipsychotics and a moderate level for ponatinib, nilotinib, darunavir, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. Drug dose and treatment duration may modify the risk. For a substantial number of drugs, we found no association, and for others, there were insufficient data to categorize risk. We identified a high level of association of IS with a limited number of drugs, a potential association with some, and a lack of data for others. The summarized information may help clinicians to estimate the contribution of a drug to an IS, to better assess drug benefit-risk ratios, and to support decisions about using specific drugs.},

Methods: All adults who experienced OHCA VF in Olmsted County, MN, from 1990 to 2008, survived more than 6 months postarrest, and were alive at the time of study recruitment were invited to participate in structured neuropsychological testing and a neurologic examination. Cognitive test results were compared to the normal population using the Mayo's Older Adults Normative Studies. Linear regression models were fit to evaluate each neuropsychological test result in relation to call-to-shock time, sex, age at cardiac arrest, time elapsed since event, witnessed vs unwitnessed arrest, and administration of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Results: Of 332 OHCA VF arrests, 140 people (42.2\%, 95\% confidence interval 36.9\%\textendash 47.5\%) survived to discharge. No patient entered a minimally conscious or permanent vegetative state. Long-term survivors (n ϭ 47, median survival 7.8 years postarrest) had lower scores on measures of long-term memory and learning efficiency (p ϭ 0.001) but higher than average scores on verbal IQ (p ϭ 0.001).

Conclusions: Long-term survivors of OHCA VF have long-term memory deficits compared to the normal population at the same age and education level. These findings provide a baseline for cognitive outcomes studies of OHCA VF as new techniques are developed to improve survival. Neurology\textregistered{} 2011;77:1438\textendash 1445},

  abstract = {Population health researchers from different fields often address similar substantive questions but rely on different study designs, reflecting their home disciplines. This is especially true in studies involving causal inference, for which semantic and substantive differences inhibit interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration. In this paper, we group nonrandomized study designs into two categories: those that use confounder-control (such as regression adjustment or propensity score matching) and those that rely on an instrument (such as instru\- mental variables, regression discontinuity, or differences-in-differences approaches). Using the Shadish, Cook, and Campbell framework for evaluating threats to validity, we contrast the assumptions, strengths, and limi\- tations of these two approaches and illustrate differences with examples from the literature on education and health. Across disciplines, all methods to test a hypothesized causal relationship involve unverifiable assump\- tions, and rarely is there clear justification for exclusive reliance on one method. Each method entails trade-offs between statistical power, internal validity, measurement quality, and generalizability. The choice between confounder-control and instrument-based methods should be guided by these tradeoffs and consideration of the most important limitations of previous work in the area. Our goals are to foster common understanding of the methods available for causal inference in population health research and the tradeoffs between them; to encourage researchers to objectively evaluate what can be learned from methods outside one's home discipline; and to facilitate the selection of methods that best answer the investigator's scientific questions.},

There is, however, no consensus on how to move research into a `post               p               \,{$<$}\,0.05' era. We present a potential route forward via the Analysis of Credibility, a novel methodology that allows researchers to go beyond the simplistic dichotomy of significance testing and extract more insight from new findings. Using standard summary statistics, AnCred assesses the credibility of significant and non-significant findings on the basis of their evidential weight, and in the context of existing knowledge. The outcome is expressed in quantitative terms of direct relevance to the substantive research question, providing greater protection against misinterpretation. Worked examples are given to illustrate how AnCred extracts additional insight from the outcome of typical research study designs. Its ability to cast light on the use of               p               -values, the interpretation of non-significant findings and the so-called `replication crisis' is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash The optimal level for blood pressure after endovascular thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke is not well established. We sought to evaluate the association of post-endovascular thrombectomy systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels with clinical outcomes. Methods\textemdash We included endovascular thrombectomy\textendash treated patients registered from 2014 to 2017 in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke International Thrombectomy Registry. The mean 24-hour SBP after endovascular thrombectomy treatment was analyzed both as a continuous variable and in intervals. The primary outcome was 3-month functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score of 0\textendash 2). The secondary outcomes were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) and 3-month mortality. The SBP interval with the highest proportion of functional independence was chosen as reference. All analyses were performed for successful or unsuccessful recanalization (modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia score {$\geq$}2b or {$<$}2b, respectively). The results were adjusted for known confounders in logistic regression models. Results\textemdash In the multivariable analyses, a higher SBP value as a continuous variable was associated unfavorably with all outcomes in patients with successful recanalization (n=2920) and with more SICH in patients with unsuccessful recanalization (n=711). SBP interval {$\geq$}160 mm\,Hg was associated with less functional independence (adjusted odds ratio, 0.28 [95\% CIs, 0.15\textendash 0.53]) and more SICH (adjusted odds ratio, 6.82 [95\% CIs, 1.53\textendash 38.09]) compared with reference 100 to 119 mm\,Hg in patients with successful recanalization. SBP {$\geq$}160 mm\,Hg was associated with more SICH (adjusted odds ratio, 6.62 [95\% CIs, 1.07\textendash 51.05]) compared with reference 120 to 139 mm\,Hg in patients with unsuccessful recanalization. Conclusions\textemdash Higher SBP values were associated with less functional independence at 3 months in patients with successful recanalization and with more SICH regardless of recanalization status.\hspace{0.6em}\,({$\mkern1mu$}Stroke. 2020;51:519-525.

Previously, CTA was reserved for patients presenting within 6 hours with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score {$\geq$}6. We compared treatment processes and outcomes between patients with AIS admitted 1 year before (n=388) and after (n=515) protocol implementation.Results\textemdash After protocol implementation, more AIS patients underwent CTA (91\% versus 61\%; P{$<$}0.001) and had CTA performed at the same time as the initial noncontrast computed tomography scan (78\% versus 35\%; P{$<$}0.001). Median time from emergency department arrival to CTA was also shorter (29 [interquartile range, 16\textendash 53] versus 43 [interquartile range, 29\textendash 112] minutes; P{$<$}0.001), more cases of LVO were detected (166 versus 96; 32\% versus 25\% of all AIS; P=0.014), and more mechanical thrombectomy procedures were performed (108 versus 68; 21\% versus 18\% of all AIS; P=0.196). Among LVO patients who presented within 6 hours of last known well, median time from last known well to mechanical thrombectomy was shorter (3.5 [interquartile range, 2.8\textendash 4.8] versus 4.1 [interquartile range, 3.3\textendash 5.6] hours; P=0.038), and more patients were discharged with a favorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale 4\textendash 5, 53\% versus 37\%; P=0.029). The odds of having a favorable outcome after protocol implementation was not significant (odds ratio, 1.84 [95\% CI, 0.98\textendash 3.45]; P=0.059) after controlling for age and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score.Conclusions\textemdash Performing CTA and noncontrast computed tomography together as an initial assessment for all AIS patients presenting within 24 hours of last known well improved LVO detection, increased the mechanical thrombectomy treatment population, hastened intervention, and was associated with a trend toward improved outcome among LVO patients presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset.},

  abstract = {Background: Diagnostic uncertainty occurs frequently in emergency medical care, with more than one-third of patients leaving the emergency department (ED) without a clear diagnosis. Despite this frequency, ED providers are not adequately trained on how to discuss diagnostic uncertainty with these patients, who often leave the ED confused and concerned. To address this training need, we developed the Uncertainty Communication Education Module (UCEM) to teach physicians how to discuss diagnostic uncertainty. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the UCEM in improving physician communications. Methods: The trial is a multicenter, two-arm randomized controlled trial designed to teach communication skills using simulation-based mastery learning (SBML). Resident emergency physicians from two training programs will be randomly assigned to immediate or delayed receipt of the two-part UCEM intervention after completing a baseline standardized patient encounter. The two UCEM components are: 1) a web-based interactive module, and 2) a smart-phone-based game. Both formats teach and reinforce communication skills for patient cases involving diagnostic uncertainty. Following baseline testing, participants in the immediate intervention arm will complete a remote deliberate practice session via a video platform and subsequently return for a second study visit to assess if they have achieved mastery. Participants in the delayed intervention arm will receive access to UCEM and remote deliberate practice after the second study visit. The primary outcome of interest is the proportion of residents in the immediate intervention arm who achieve mastery at the second study visit. Discussion: Patients' understanding of the care they received has implications for care quality, safety, and patient satisfaction, especially when they are discharged without a definitive diagnosis. Developing a patient-centered diagnostic uncertainty communication strategy will improve safety of acute care discharges. Although use of SBML is a resource intensive educational approach, this trial has been deliberately designed to have a low-resource, scalable intervention that would allow for widespread dissemination and uptake. Trial registration: The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04021771). Registration date: July 16, 2019.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To prospectively assess outcomes in major areas of life function at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months after msTBI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study, as part of the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) study, was conducted at 18 level 1 trauma centers in the US from February 2014 to August 2018 and prospectively assessed longitudinal outcomes, with follow-up to 12 months postinjury. Participants were patients with msTBI (Glasgow Coma Scale scores 3-12) extracted from a larger group of patients with mild, moderate, or severe TBI who were enrolled in TRACK-TBI. Data analysis took place from October 2019 to April 2021. EXPOSURES Moderate or severe TBI. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The Glasgow Outcome Scale\textendash Extended (GOSE) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) were used to assess global functional status 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Scores on the GOSE were dichotomized to determine favorable (scores 4-8) vs unfavorable (scores 1-3) outcomes. Neurocognitive testing and patient reported outcomes at 12 months postinjury were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 484 eligible patients were included from the 2679 individuals in the TRACK-TBI study. Participants with severe TBI (n = 362; 283 men [78.2\%]; median [interquartile range] age, 35.5 [25-53] years) and moderate TBI (n = 122; 98 men [80.3\%]; median [interquartile range] age, 38 [25-53] years) were comparable on demographic and premorbid variables. At 2 weeks postinjury, 36 of 290 participants with severe TBI (12.4\%) and 38 of 93 participants with moderate TBI (41\%) had favorable outcomes (GOSE scores 4-8); 301 of 322 in the severe TBI group (93.5\%) and 81 of 103 in the moderate TBI group (78.6\%) had moderate disability or worse on the DRS (total score Ն4). By 12 months postinjury, 142 of 271 with severe TBI (52.4\%) and 54 of 72 with moderate TBI (75\%) achieved favorable outcomes. Nearly 1 in 5 participants with severe TBI (52 of 270 [19.3\%]) and 1 in 3 with moderate TBI (23 of 71 [32\%]) reported no disability (DRS score 0) at 12 months. Among participants in a vegetative state at 2 weeks, 62 of 79 (78\%) regained consciousness and 14 of 56 with available data (25\%) regained orientation by 12 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, patients with msTBI frequently demonstrated major functional gains, including recovery of independence, between 2 weeks and 12 months postinjury. Severe impairment in the short term did not portend poor outcomes in a substantial minority of patients with msTBI. When discussing prognosis during the first 2 weeks after injury, clinicians should be particularly cautious about making early, definitive prognostic statements suggesting poor outcomes and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in patients with msTBI.},

We examined the association between dedicated neurocritical care units and mortality and the effects of standardized management protocols for severe traumatic brain injury. Design: We surveyed trauma medical directors from centers participating in the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program to obtain information about ICU structure and processes of care. Survey data were then linked to the Trauma Quality Improvement Program registry, and random-intercept hierarchical multivariable modeling was used to evaluate the association between dedicated neurocritical care units, the presence of standardized management protocols and mortality. Setting: Trauma centers in North America participating in Trauma Quality Improvement Program. Patients: Data were analyzed from 9,773 adult patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury admitted to 134 Trauma Quality Improvement Program centers between 2011 and 2013. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Only 50 ICUs (37\&percnt;) were dedicated neurocritical care units, whereas 84 (63\&percnt;) were general ICUs. Rates of standardized management protocols were similar comparing dedicated neurocritical care units and general ICUs. Among severe TBI patients admitted to trauma centers enrolled in Trauma Quality Improvement Program, care in a dedicated neurocritical care unit did not improve risk-adjusted in-hospital survival (odds ratio, 0.97; 95\&percnt; CI, 0.80\textendash 1.19; p = 0.79). However, the presence of a standardized management protocol for these patients was associated with lower risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.77; 95\&percnt; CI, 0.63\textendash 0.93; p = 0.009). Conclusions: Compared with dedicated neurocritical care models, standardized management protocols for severe traumatic brain injured patients are process-targeted intervention strategies that may improve clinical outcomes.}

While much has been written about statistical thinking, a complementary form of thinking that appears in the practice of data analysis is design thinking\textemdash the problem-solving process to understand the people for whom a solution is being designed. For a given problem, there can be significant or subtle differences in how a data analyst (or producer of a data analysis) constructs, creates, or designs a data analysis, including differences in the choice of methods, tooling, and workflow. These choices can affect the data analysis products themselves and the experience of the consumer of the data analysis. Therefore, the role of a producer can be thought of as designing the data analysis with a set of design principles. Here, we introduce design principles for data analysis and describe how they can be mapped to data analyses in a quantitative and informative manner. We also provide data showing variation of principles within and between producers of data analyses. Our work suggests a formal mechanism to describe data analyses based on design principles. These results provide guidance for future work in characterizing the data analytic process. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

This study aimed to identify the minimal degree of midline shift (MLS) that predicts outcome in a cohort encompassing a broad range of patients with acute stroke. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Patient-level data from six acute stroke clinical trials were combined with endovascular thrombectomy registries from two academic referral centers, generating a combined cohort of 1977 patients. MLS was extracted from the original trial data or measured on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging that was obtained a median of 47.0 h (interquartile range 27.0\textendash 75.1 h) after stroke onset. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of poor outcome and the minimal clinically relevant MLS threshold. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The presence of MLS was a predictor of poor outcome, independent of baseline clinical and demographic factors (adjusted odds ratio 4.46, 95\% confidence interval 3.56\textendash 5.59, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Examining the full range of MLS values identified, a value of greater than 3 mm was the critical threshold that significantly predicted poor outcome (adjusted odds ratio 3.20 [1.31\textendash 7.82], p\,=\,0.011). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} These results show that the presence of MLS predicts poor outcome and, specifically, MLS value greater than 3 mm is an important threshold across a variety of clinical settings. These findings may have relevance for the design and interpretation of future trials for antiedema therapies.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive stroke centers (CSCs) provide a full spectrum of neurological and neurosurgical services to treat complex stroke patients. CSCs have been shown to improve clinical outcomes and mitigate disparities in ischemic stroke patients. It is believed that CSCs also improve outcomes in hemorrhagic stroke. We used the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS) database, which includes data on patients discharged with a primary diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH; International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] 431) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH; ICD-9 430) from all nonfederal acute care hospitals in New Jersey (NJ) between 1996 and 2012. Out-of-hospital deaths were assessed by matching MIDAS records with NJ death registration files. The primary outcome variable was 90-day all-cause mortality. The primary independent variable was CSC versus primary stroke center (PSC) and nonstroke center (NSC) admission. Multivariate logistic models were used to measure the effects of available covariates. Overall, 36 981 patients were admitted with a primary diagnosis of ICH or SAH during the study period, of which 40\% were admitted to a CSC. Patients admitted to CSCs were more likely to have neurosurgical or endovascular interventions than those admitted to a PSC/NSC (18.9\% vs. 4.7\%; P{$<$}0.0001). CSC admission was associated with lower adjusted 90-day mortality (35.0\% vs. 40.3\%; odds ratio, 0.93; 95\% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.97) for hemorrhagic stroke. This was particularly true for those admitted with SAH. Hemorrhagic stroke patients admitted to CSCs are more likely to receive neurosurgical and endovascular treatments and be alive at 90 days than patients admitted to other hospitals.}

We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm\textemdash and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it\textemdash as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to ``ban'' p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.},

In this article, we review research on how applied researchers who are not primarily statisticians misuse and misinterpret p-values in practice and how this can lead to errors in the interpretation of evidence. We also present new data showing, perhaps surprisingly, that researchers who are primarily statisticians are also prone to misuse and misinterpret p-values thus resulting in similar errors.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Targeting a cerebral perfusion pressure optimal for cerebral autoregulation (CPPopt) has been gaining more attention to prevent secondary damage after acute neurological injury. Brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO2) can identify insufficient cerebral blood flow and secondary brain injury. Defining the relationship between CPPopt and PbtO2 after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage may result in (1) mechanistic insights into whether and how CPPopt-based strategies might be beneficial and (2) establishing support for the use of PbtO2 as an adjunctive monitor for adequate or optimal local perfusion. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected 2-center dataset of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with or without later diagnosis of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). CPPopt was calculated as the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) value corresponding to the lowest pressure reactivity index (moving correlation coefficient of mean arterial and intracranial pressure). The relationship of (hourly) deltaCPP (CPP-CPPopt) and PbtO2 was investigated using natural spline regression analysis. Data after DCI diagnosis were excluded. Brain tissue hypoxia was defined as PbtO2 {$<$}20 mmHg. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one patients were included with a median of 44.0 (interquartile range, 20.8\textendash 78.3) hourly CPPopt/PbtO2 datapoints. The regression plot revealed a nonlinear relationship between PbtO2 and deltaCPP (P{$<$}0.001) with PbtO2 decrease with deltaCPP {$<$}0 mmHg and stable PbtO2 with deltaCPP {$\geq$}0mmHg, although there was substantial individual variation. Brain tissue hypoxia (34.6\% of all measurements) was more frequent with deltaCPP {$<$}0 mmHg. These dynamics were similar in patients with or without DCI. CONCLUSIONS: We found a nonlinear relationship between PbtO2 and deviation of patients' CPP from CPPopt in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients in the pre-DCI period. CPP values below calculated CPPopt were associated with lower PbtO2. Nevertheless, the nature of PbtO2 measurements is complex, and the variability is high. Combined multimodality monitoring with CPP/CPPopt and PbtO2 should be recommended to redefine individual pressure targets (CPP/CPPopt) and retain the option to detect local perfusion deficits during DCI (PbtO2), which cannot be fulfilled by both measurements interchangeably.},

Consecutive adult patients with ischemic stroke who received IVT (both with and without thrombectomy) were included. Patients whose last known DOAC ingestion was more than 48 hours before stroke onset were excluded. A total of 832 patients with recent DOAC use were compared with 32\,375 controls without recent DOAC use. Data were collected from January 2008 to December 2021.Prior DOAC therapy (confirmed last ingestion within 48 hours prior to IVT) compared with no prior oral anticoagulation.The main outcome was sICH within 36 hours after IVT, defined as worsening of at least 4 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and attributed to radiologically evident intracranial hemorrhage. Outcomes were compared according to different selection strategies (DOAC-level measurements, DOAC reversal treatment, IVT with neither DOAC-level measurement nor idarucizumab). The association of sICH with DOAC plasma levels and very recent ingestions was explored in sensitivity analyses.Of 33\,207 included patients, 14\,458 (43.5\%) were female, and the median (IQR) age was 73 (62-80) years. The median (IQR) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 9 (5-16). Of the 832 patients taking DOAC, 252 (30.3\%) received DOAC reversal before IVT (all idarucizumab), 225 (27.0\%) had DOAC-level measurements, and 355 (42.7\%) received IVT without measuring DOAC plasma levels or reversal treatment. The unadjusted rate of sICH was 2.5\% (95\% CI, 1.6-3.8) in patients taking DOACs compared with 4.1\% (95\% CI, 3.9-4.4) in control patients using no anticoagulants. Recent DOAC ingestion was associated with lower odds of sICH after IVT compared with no anticoagulation (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95\% CI, 0.36-0.92). This finding was consistent among the different selection strategies and in sensitivity analyses of patients with detectable plasma levels or very recent ingestion.In this study, there was insufficient evidence of excess harm associated with off-label IVT in selected patients after ischemic stroke with recent DOAC ingestion.},

We therefore tested the hypothesis that early surgery compared with initial conservative treatment could improve outcome in these patients. METHODS: In this international, parallel-group trial undertaken in 78 centres in 27 countries, we compared early surgical haematoma evacuation within 12 h of randomisation plus medical treatment with initial medical treatment alone (later evacuation was allowed if judged necessary). An automatic telephone and internet-based randomisation service was used to assign patients to surgery and initial conservative treatment in a 1:1 ratio. The trial was not masked. The primary outcome was a prognosis-based dichotomised (favourable or unfavourable) outcome of the 8 point Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) obtained by questionnaires posted to patients at 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN22153967. FINDINGS: 307 of 601 patients were randomly assigned to early surgery and 294 to initial conservative treatment; 298 and 291 were followed up at 6 months, respectively; and 297 and 286 were included in the analysis, respectively. 174 (59\%) of 297 patients in the early surgery group had an unfavourable outcome versus 178 (62\%) of 286 patients in the initial conservative treatment group (absolute difference 3{$\cdot$}7\% [95\% CI -4{$\cdot$}3 to 11{$\cdot$}6], odds ratio 0{$\cdot$}86 [0{$\cdot$}62 to 1{$\cdot$}20]; p=0{$\cdot$}367). INTERPRETATION: The STICH II results confirm that early surgery does not increase the rate of death or disability at 6 months and might have a small but clinically relevant survival advantage for patients with spontaneous superficial intracerebral haemorrhage without intraventricular haemorrhage.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase bolus followed by infusion is a global standard of care for patients with acute ischaemic stroke. We aimed to determine whether tenecteplase given as a single bolus might increase reperfusion compared with this standard of care. METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, registry-linked, randomised, controlled trial (AcT), patients were enrolled from 22 primary and comprehensive stroke centres across Canada. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 18 years or older, with a diagnosis of ischaemic stroke causing disabling neurological deficit, presenting within 4{$\cdot$}5 h of symptom onset, and eligible for thrombolysis per Canadian guidelines. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1), using a previously validated minimal sufficient balance algorithm to balance allocation by site and a secure real-time web-based server, to either intravenous tenecteplase (0{$\cdot$}25 mg/kg to a maximum of 25 mg) or alteplase (0{$\cdot$}9 mg/kg to a maximum of 90mg; 0{$\cdot$}09 mg/kg as a bolus and then a 60 min infusion of the remaining 0{$\cdot$}81 mg/kg). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-1 at 90-120 days after treatment, assessed via blinded review in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (ie, all patients randomly assigned to treatment who did not withdraw consent). Non-inferiority was met if the lower 95\% CI of the difference in the proportion of patients who met the primary outcome between the tenecteplase and alteplase groups was more than -5\%. Safety was assessed in all patients who received any of either thrombolytic agent and who were reported as treated. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03889249, and is closed to accrual. FINDINGS: Between Dec 10, 2019, and Jan 25, 2022, 1600 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to tenecteplase (n=816) or alteplase (n=784), of whom 1577 were included in the ITT population (n=806 tenecteplase; n=771 alteplase).

  abstract = {Background.{$\quad$} Treatment of suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a cornerstone of many antibiotic regimens; however, there is associated toxicity. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals screen each patient for MRSA nares colonization on admission and transfer. The objective was to determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of MRSA screening in the determination of subsequent positive clinical culture for MRSA. High NPVs with MRSA nares screening may be used as a stewardship tool. Methods.{$\quad$} This was a retrospective cohort study across VA medical centers nationwide from 1 January 2007 to 1 January 2018. Data from patients with MRSA nares screening were obtained from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Subsequent clinical cultures within 7 days of the nares swab were evaluated for the presence of MRSA. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and NPVs were calculated for the entire cohort as well as subgroups for specific culture sites. Results.{$\quad$} This cohort yielded 561 325 clinical cultures from a variety of anatomical sites. The sensitivity and specificity for positive MRSA clinical culture were 67.4\% and 81.2\%, respectively. The NPV of MRSA nares screening for ruling out MRSA infection was 96.5\%. The NPV for bloodstream infections was 96.5\%, for intraabdominal cultures it was 98.6\%, for respiratory cultures it was 96.1\%, for wound cultures it was 93.1\%, and for cultures from the urinary system it was 99.2\%. Conclusion.{$\quad$} Given the high NPVs, MRSA nares screening may be a powerful stewardship tool for deescalation and avoidance of empirical anti-MRSA therapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study evaluates the benefit of endovascular treatment (EVT) for patients with extensive baseline stroke compared with best medical treatment. METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter study compares EVT and best medical treatment for computed tomography (CT)\textendash based selection of patients with extensive baseline infarcts (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score {$\leq$}5) attributed to anterior circulation stroke. Patients were selected from the German Stroke Registry and 3 tertiary stroke centers. Primary functional end points were rates of good (modified Rankin Scale score of {$\leq$}3) and very poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of {$\geq$}5) at 90 days. Secondary safety end point was the occurrence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Angiographic outcome was evaluated with the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scale. RESULTS: After 1:1 pair matching, a total of 248 patients were compared by treatment arm. Good functional outcome was observed in 27.4\% in the EVT group, and in 25\% in the best medical treatment group (P=0.665). Advanced age (adjusted odds ratio, 1.08 [95\% CI, 1.05\textendash 1.10], P{$<$}0.001) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 6.35 [95\% CI, 2.08\textendash 19.35], P{$<$}0.001) were independently associated with very poor outcome. Mortality (43.5\% versus 28.9\%, P=0.025) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (16.1\% versus 5.6\%, P=0.008) were significantly higher in the EVT group. The lowest rates of good functional outcome ({$\approx$}15\%) were observed in groups of failed and partial recanalization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scale score of 0/1\textendash 2a), whereas patients with complete recanalization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scale score of 3) with recanalization attempts {$\leq$}2 benefitted the most (modified Rankin Scale score of {$\leq$}3:42.3\%, P=0.074) compared with best medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In daily clinical practice, EVT for CT\textendash based selected patients with low Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score anterior circulation stroke may not be beneficial and is associated with increased risk for hemorrhage and mortality, especially in the elderly. However, first- or second-pass complete recanalization seems to reveal a clinical benefit of EVT highlighting the vulnerability of the low Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score subgroup.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the most fatal and debilitating conditions in the world. Current clinical management in severe TBI patients is mainly concerned with reducing secondary insults and optimizing the balance between substrate delivery and consumption. Over the past decades, multimodality monitoring has become more widely available, and clinical management protocols have been published that recommend potential interventions to correct pathophysiological derangements. Even while evidence from randomized clinical trials is still lacking for many of the recommended interventions, these protocols and algorithms can be useful to define a clear standard of therapy where novel interventions can be added or be compared to. Over the past decade, more attention has been paid to holistic management, in which hemodynamic, respiratory, inflammatory or coagulation disturbances are detected and treated accordingly. Considerable variability with regards to the trajectories of recovery exists. Even while most of the recovery occurs in the first months after TBI, substantial changes may still occur in a later phase. Neuroprognostication is challenging in these patients, where a risk of self-fulfilling prophecies is a matter of concern. The present article provides a comprehensive and practical review of the current best practice in clinical management and long-term outcomes of moderate to severe TBI in adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Intravenous fluids are recommended for the treatment of patients who are in septic shock, but higher fluid volumes have been associated with harm in patients who are in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS In this international, randomized trial, we assigned patients with septic shock in the ICU who had received at least 1 liter of intravenous fluid to receive restricted intravenous fluid or standard intravenous fluid therapy; patients were included if the onset of shock had been within 12 hours before screening. The primary outcome was death from any cause within 90 days after randomization. RESULTS We enrolled 1554 patients; 770 were assigned to the restrictive-fluid group and 784 to the standard-fluid group. Primary outcome data were available for 1545 patients (99.4\%). In the ICU, the restrictive-fluid group received a median of 1798 ml of intravenous fluid (interquartile range, 500 to 4366); the standard-fluid group received a median of 3811 ml (interquartile range, 1861 to 6762). At 90 days, death had occurred in 323 of 764 patients (42.3\%) in the restrictive-fluid group, as compared with 329 of 781 patients (42.1\%) in the standard-fluid group (adjusted absolute difference, 0.1 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -4.7 to 4.9; P\,=\,0.96). In the ICU, serious adverse events occurred at least once in 221 of 751 patients (29.4\%) in the restrictive-fluid group and in 238 of 772 patients (30.8\%) in the standard-fluid group (adjusted absolute difference, -1.7 percentage points; 99\% CI, -7.7 to 4.3). At 90 days after randomization, the numbers of days alive without life support and days alive and out of the hospital were similar in the two groups.

A review of the literature was performed, followed by a search using links and references of the detected articles. Additionally, homepages for German institutions of public health were screened. Substantial limitations of RCTs and EBM health care could be identified. Based on the selected literature, 80\% of the medical treatments have low evidence. RCTs are expensive and are mainly performed by the industry nowadays. A publication bias for positive results exists. Some RCTs are of low external validity. Many studies have a low fragility index. Nonetheless, negative RCTs could be of benefit for the patients. The results of RCTs, gained in a distinct patient population, are partially generalized. RCTs should be analyzed critically before adopting the results to daily clinical routine. It is not really justified to use RCTs and EBM for political and economic decisionmaking and legal issues as seen today.},

  abstract = {Status epilepticus causes prolonged or repetitive seizures that, if left untreated, can lead to neuronal injury, severe disability, coma and death in paediatric and adult populations. While convulsive status epilepticus can be diagnosed using clinical features alone, non-convulsive status epilepticus requires confirmation by electroencephalogram. Early seizure control remains key in preventing the complications of status epilepticus. This is especially true for convulsive status epilepticus, which has stronger evidence supporting the benefit of treatment on outcomes. When status epilepticus becomes refractory, often due to gamma-aminobutyric acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulation, anaesthetic drugs are needed to suppress seizure activity, of which there is limited evidence regarding the selection, dose or duration of their use. Seizure monitoring with electroencephalogram is often needed when patients do not return to baseline or during anaesthetic wean; however, it is resource-intensive, costly, only available in highly specialised centres and has not been shown to improve functional outcomes. Thus, the treatment goals and aggressiveness of therapy remain under debate, especially for non-convulsive status epilepticus, where prolonged therapeutic coma can lead to severe complications. This review presents an evidence-based, clinically-oriented and comprehensive review of status epilepticus and its definitions, aetiologies, treatments, outcomes and prognosis at different stages of the patient's journey.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Cardiogenic shock is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Although inotropic support is a mainstay of medical therapy for cardiogenic shock, little evidence exists to guide the selection of inotropic agents in clinical practice. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with cardiogenic shock to receive milrinone or dobutamine in a double-blind fashion. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death from any cause, resuscitated cardiac arrest, receipt of a cardiac transplant or mechanical circulatory support, nonfatal myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack or stroke diagnosed by a neurologist, or initiation of renal replacement therapy. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary composite outcome. RESULTS A total of 192 participants (96 in each group) were enrolled. The treatment groups did not differ significantly with respect to the primary outcome; a primary outcome event occurred in 47 participants (49\%) in the milrinone group and in 52 participants (54\%) in the dobutamine group (relative risk, 0.90; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 1.19; P\,=\,0.47). There were also no significant differences between the groups with respect to secondary outcomes, including in-hospital death (37\% and 43\% of the participants, respectively; relative risk, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 1.21), resuscitated cardiac arrest (7\% and 9\%; hazard ratio, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.29 to 2.07), receipt of mechanical circulatory support (12\% and 15\%; hazard ratio, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.36 to 1.71), or initiation of renal replacement therapy (22\% and 17\%; hazard ratio, 1.39; 95\% CI, 0.73 to 2.67). CONCLUSIONS In patients with cardiogenic shock, no significant difference between milrinone and dobutamine was found with respect to the primary composite outcome or important secondary outcomes.

Despite consensus on potential benefits of BP lowering in the acute phase of intracerebral hemorrhage, controversies persist over the timing, mechanisms, and approaches to treatment. BP control is even more complex for subarachnoid hemorrhage, where there are rationales for both BP lowering and elevation in reducing the risks of rebleeding and delayed cerebral ischemia, respectively. Efforts to disentangle the evidence has involved detailed exploration of individual patient data from clinical trials through meta-analysis to determine strength and direction of BP change in relation to key outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage, and which likely also apply to subarachnoid hemorrhage. A wealth of hemodynamic data provides insights into pathophysiological interrelationships of BP and cerebral blood flow. This focused update provides an overview of current evidence, knowledge gaps, and emerging concepts on systemic hemodynamics, cerebral autoregulation and perfusion, to facilitate clinical practice recommendations and future research.},

A retrospective review was performed to compare (1) the clinical outcomes, as defined by percent mortality and disposition at discharge, between patients with a primary diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage treated in 1995 in medical or surgical ICUs and those treated in the same medical facility in an NSICU in 1997; and (2) the efficiency of care, as defined by length of ICU stay, total cost of care, and specific resource use, between patients treated in the NSICU and national benchmark standards for general ICUs during the 1997 fiscal year (FY). In the latter, extracted patient population data on neurosurgery patients requiring ICU treatment during FY 1997 were used with the following adjacent-disease related group (A-DRG)-coded diseases: craniotomy with and without coma or intracerebral hemorrhage, and skull fracture with and without coma lasting longer than 1 hour. Outcome measures of percent mortality and disposition at discharge in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were significantly improved (P {$<$} .05), compared with those in a similar cohort treated 2 years earlier in a general ICU setting. Also, patients treated in the NSICU had shorter hospital stays (P {$<$} .01) and lower total costs of care (P {$<$} .01) than a national benchmark. The data suggest that a neuroscience specialty ICU arena staffed by specialty-trained intensivists and nurses is beneficial.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unclear what factors providers take into account to determine the target blood pressure (BP) after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients who had acute ischemic stroke. We aimed to understand practice patterns of post-MT BP management across institutions in the United States. METHODS: We surveyed StrokeNet institutions providing MT and post-MT care with an online questionnaire, designed to understand institutional post-MT BP management practices. RESULTS: Of 131 potential institutions, 58 completed the survey. The majority of institutions target systolic BP (SBP, n\,=\,53, 91\%) during the first 24 hours post-MT (n\,=\,32, 55\%) using nicardipine as a first-line agent (n\,=\,43, 74\%). At most institutions, BP management is determined by a team of physicians in a collaborative fashion (n\,=\,30, 52\%) and individualized on a case-by-case basis (n\,=\,39, 67\%) after taking the reperfusion status into account (n\,=\,42, 72\%). In patients with successful reperfusion, 36\% (n\,=\,21) of the institutions target SBP in the range of 120-139\,mm~Hg, 21\% (n\,=\,12) target 140-159\,mm~Hg, and 28\% (n\,=\,16) would accept any value less than or equal to 180\,mm~Hg. In patients with unsuccessful reperfusion, 43\% (n\,=\,25) would accept any SBP value less than or equal to 180\,mm~Hg and 10\% (n\,=\,6) would target SBP less than or equal to 220~mm~Hg. CONCLUSIONS: We found that majority of the institutions do not have a standardized protocol for post-MT BP management. There was interinstitutional heterogeneity in the preferred target of SBP post-MT and most institutions target values of SBP lower than 180\,mm~Hg in post-MT patients. Prospective data and randomized control trial are needed to identify the optimal target BP.},

We calculated BPV during the first 24 hours after EVT for systolic and diastolic BP using 5 methodologies, then divided BPV into tertiles and compared the highest to lowest tertile using logistic regression. Results\textemdash{} Of the 443 patients included in our analysis, 259 (58.5\%) had a poor outcome, and 79 (17.8\%) died. All measures of BPV were significantly higher in patients with poor outcome or death, but the difference was more pronounced for systolic than diastolic BPV. In the logistic regression, the highest tertile of systolic BPV consistently predicted poor outcome (odds ratio, 1.8\textendash 3.5, all P{$<$}0.05). The rate of death within 90 days was 10.1\% in the tertile with the lowest systolic BPV versus 25.2\% in the tertile with the highest BPV (P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions\textemdash{} In EVT-treated stroke patients, higher BPV in the first 24 hours is associated with worse 90-day outcome. This association was more robust for systolic BPV. The mechanism by which BPV may exert a negative influence on neurological outcome remains unknown, but the consistency of this association warrants further investigation and potentially intervention.},

Common indications for DOACs among these patients include stroke prevention from atrial fibrillation, treatment of venous and pulmonary thrombosis, and coronary and peripheral atherosclerotic disease. Novel indications for DOAC use are expected to emerge and may increase the proportion of patients with AIS who are undergoing treatment with DOACs. Current US and European acute stroke treatment guidelines recommend withholding intravenous thrombolysis (thrombolysis), a morbidity- and mortality-saving AIS treatment for patients with recent a DOAC use. DOACs have emerged as preferred anticoagulants over vitamin K antagonists due to a favorable safety profile, particularly a lower risk of severe systemic and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). However, if this translates into a lower risk of hemorrhagic complications of thrombolysis for AIS in the setting of DOAC treatment is yet to be definitively determined as data supporting this practice are limited and heterogenous. The present study by Meinel et al meaningfully advances the field by generating these critical data. Comparative analyses of different patient selection paradigms for thrombolysis in the presence of DOACs provide additional, timely relevance to the study.},

  abstract = {National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), measured a few hours to days after stroke onset, is an attractive outcome measure for stroke research. NIHSS at the time of presentation (baseline NIHSS) strongly predicts the follow-up NIHSS. Because of the need to account for the baseline NIHSS in the analysis of follow-up NIHSS as an outcome measure, a common and intuitive approach is to define study outcome as the change in NIHSS from baseline to follow-up ({$\increment$}NIHSS). However, this approach has important limitations. Analyzing {$\increment$}NIHSS implies a very strong assumption about the relationship between baseline and follow-up NIHSS that is unlikely to be satisfied, drawing into question the validity of the resulting statistical analysis. This reduces the precision of the estimates of treatment effects and the power of clinical trials that use this approach to analysis. ANCOVA allows for the analysis of follow-up NIHSS as the dependent variable while adjusting for baseline NIHSS as a covariate in the model and addresses several challenges of using {$\increment$}NIHSS outcome using simple bivariate comparisons (eg, a t test, Wilcoxon rank-sum, linear regression without adjustment for baseline) for stroke research. In this article, we use clinical trial simulations to illustrate that variability in NIHSS outcome is less when follow-up NIHSS is adjusted for baseline compared to {$\increment$}NIHSS and how a reduction in this variability improves the power. We outline additional, important clinical and statistical arguments to support the superiority of ANCOVA using the final measurement of the NIHSS adjusted for baseline over, and caution against using, the simple bivariate comparison of absolute NIHSS change (ie, delta).},

Therefore, we determined whether the use of saline is associated with a lower risk of disability and death in patients with aSAH compared with balanced crystalloids. Methods We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of SMART (Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial), a pragmatic, unblinded, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover clinical trial that enrolled 15~802 adults between June 2015 and April 2017. We compared IV administration of saline to balanced crystalloids in consecutively enrolled patients with aSAH aged 18 years or older whose ruptured aneurysm was procedurally secured at a single academic center in the United States. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 [no symptoms]\textendash 6 [death]) at 90~days obtained from a prospective institutional stroke registry. Secondary outcome included death by 90~days. Logistic or proportional odds regression models were used to test for between-group differences adjusted for age, hypertension, aSAH grade, and procedure type. Results Of the 79 patients with aSAH procedurally treated during the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial study period, 78 were enrolled (median age, 58 years; interquartile range, 49\textendash 64.5; 64\% female), with 41 (53\%) assigned to saline and 37 (47\%) to balanced crystalloids. Plasma-Lyte was the primary balanced crystalloid used. Among 72 patients with 90-day modified Rankin scale assessment, the adjusted common odds ratio, for the modified Rankin scale was 0.68 (95\% CI, 0.28\textendash 1.63; P=0.39), with values {$<$}1.0 favoring saline. By 90~days, 2/39 patients (5\%) in the saline group and 9/35 (26\%) in the balanced-crystalloids group had died (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.06; 95\% CI, 0.00\textendash 0.50; P=0.02).

Clinical scoring systems can predict the mortality and functional outcome after ICH (FUNC score). FOUR score is a recently developed coma scale that incorporates brainstem reflexes.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all S-ICH patients ({$>$}18 years of age) from January 2008 to May 2010. ICH volume was calculated using the ABC/2 formula. FUNC ({$\leq$}5 or {$>$}5) and FOUR ({$\leq$}10 and {$>$}10) scores were calculated from admission data. Statistical analyses included chi-square test, positive predictive value, and relative risk assessment. Results: Total number of patients was 92. The mean age of presentation was 64.6 {$\pm$} 15.6 years (range: 27\textendash 95 years). Male to female ratio was 1.6:1. Combined FUNC score {$\leq$} 5 and FOUR score {$\leq$} 10 (F2 score; 95\%) had higher positive predictive value for mortality than either FUNC score {$\leq$} 5 (82\%) or FOUR score {$\leq$} 10 (81\%).

Methods The Ethnic/Racial Variations in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study is a prospective multicenter study of ICH among adult (age {$\geq$}18 years) non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic participants. The study recruited 1,000 participants per racial/ethnic group. The present study utilized the subset of ERICH participants aged {$<$}50 years with supratentorial ICH. Functional outcome was ascertained using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with poor outcome (mRS 4\textendash 6), and analyses were compared by race/ethnicity to identify differences across these groups. Results Of the 3,000 patients with ICH enrolled in ERICH, 418 were studied (mean age 43 years, 69\% male), of whom 48 (12\%) were white, 173 (41\%) were black, and 197 (47\%) were Hispanic. For supratentorial ICH, black participants (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; p = 0.046) and Hispanic participants (OR, 0.34; p = 0.01) had better outcomes than white participants after adjustment for other factors associated with poor outcome: age, baseline disability, admission blood pressure, admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, ICH volume, deep ICH location, and intraventricular extension. Conclusions In young patients with supratentorial ICH, black and Hispanic race/ethnicity is associated with better functional outcomes, compared with white race.

  abstract = {Neurocritical care is a distinct subspecialty focusing on the optimal management of acutely ill patients with life-threatening neurologic and neurosurgical disease or with life-threatening neurologic manifestations of systemic disease. Care by expert healthcare providers to optimize neurologic recovery is necessary. Given the lack of an organizational framework and criteria for the development and maintenance of neurological critical care units (NCCUs), this document is put forth by the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS). Recommended organizational structure, personnel and processes necessary to develop a successful neurocritical care program are outlined. Methods: Under the direction of NCS Executive Leadership, a multidisciplinary writing group of NCS members was formed. After an iterative process, a framework was proposed and approved by members of the writing group. A draft was then written, which was reviewed by the NCS Quality Committee and NCS Guidelines Committee, members at large, and posted for public comment. Feedback was formally collated, reviewed and incorporated into the final document which was subsequently approved by the NCS Board of Directors.}

  abstract = {Overwhelming evidence shows the quality of reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is not optimal. Without transparent reporting, readers cannot judge the reliability and validity of trial findings nor extract information for systematic reviews. Recent methodological analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are associated with biased estimates of treatment effects. Such systematic error is seriously damaging to RCTs, which are considered the gold standard for evaluating interventions because of their ability to minimise or avoid bias. A group of scientists and editors developed the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to improve the quality of reporting of RCTs. It was first published in 1996 and updated in 2001. The statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can use for reporting an RCT. Many leading medical journals and major international editorial groups have endorsed the CONSORT statement. The statement facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of RCTs. During the 2001 CONSORT revision, it became clear that explanation and elaboration of the principles underlying the CONSORT statement would help investigators and others to write or appraise trial reports. A CONSORT explanation and elaboration article was published in 2001 alongside the 2001 version of the CONSORT statement. After an expert meeting in January 2007, the CONSORT statement has been further revised and is published as the CONSORT 2010 Statement. This update improves the wording and clarity of the previous checklist and incorporates recommendations related to topics that have only recently received recognition, such as selective outcome reporting bias. This explanatory and elaboration document\textemdash intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the CONSORT statement\textemdash has also been extensively revised. It presents the meaning and rationale for each new and updated checklist item providing examples of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies. Several examples of flow diagrams are included. The CONSORT 2010 Statement, this revised explanatory and elaboration document, and the associated website (www. consort-statement.org) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of randomised trials.},

In the present study, we estimate the effect of body mass index, intentional physical activity, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, hypertension, and cigarette smoking on the 11-year risk of ischemic stroke by sex using the parametric g-formula to control time-dependent confounders. Methods\textemdash Using data from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), we followed 6809 men and women aged 45 to 84 years. We estimated the risk of stroke under 6 hypothetical interventions: maintaining body mass index {$<$}25 kg/ m2, maintaining normotension (systolic blood pressure {$<$}140 and diastolic {$<$}90 mm\,Hg), quitting smoking, maintaining HDL {$>$}1.55 mmol/L, maintaining LDL {$<$}3.11 mmol/L, and exercising at least 210 minutes per week. The effects of joint hypothetical interventions were also simulated. Results\textemdash In men, the 11-year risk of ischemic stroke would be reduced by 85\% (95\% CI, 66\textendash 96) for all 6 hypothetical interventions.

  abstract = {In principle, experiments offer a straightforward method for social scientists to accurately estimate causal effects. However, scholars often unwittingly distort treatment effect estimates by conditioning on variables that could be affected by their experimental manipulation. Typical examples include controlling for posttreatment variables in statistical models, eliminating observations based on posttreatment criteria, or subsetting the data based on posttreatment variables. Though these modeling choices are intended to address common problems encountered when conducting experiments, they can bias estimates of causal effects. Moreover, problems associated with conditioning on posttreatment variables remain largely unrecognized in the field, which we show frequently publishes experimental studies using these practices in our discipline's most prestigious journals. We demonstrate the severity of experimental posttreatment bias analytically and document the magnitude of the potential distortions it induces using visualizations and reanalyses of real-world data. We conclude by providing applied researchers with recommendations for best practice.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To explore practitioner understanding of diagnostic reasoning. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this survey study, 723 practitioners at outpatient clinics in 8 US states were asked to estimate the probability of disease for 4 scenarios common in primary care (pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, breast cancer screening, and urinary tract infection) and the association of positive and negative test results with disease probability from June 1, 2018, to November 26, 2019. Of these practitioners, 585 responded to the survey, and 553 answered all of the questions. An expert panel developed the survey and determined correct responses based on literature review. RESULTS A total of 553 (290 resident physicians, 202 attending physicians, and 61 nurse practitioners and physician assistants) of 723 practitioners (76.5\%) fully completed the survey (median age, 32 years; interquartile range, 29-44 years; 293 female [53.0\%]; 296 [53.5\%] White). Pretest probability was overestimated in all scenarios. Probabilities of disease after positive results were overestimated as follows: pneumonia after positive radiology results, 95\% (evidence range, 46\%-65\%; comparison P {$<$} .001); breast cancer after positive mammography results, 50\% (evidence range, 3\%-9\%; P {$<$} .001); cardiac ischemia after positive stress test result, 70\% (evidence range, 2\%-11\%; P {$<$} .001); and urinary tract infection after positive urine culture result, 80\% (evidence range, 0\%-8.3\%; P {$<$} .001). Overestimates of probability of disease with negative results were also observed as follows: pneumonia after negative radiography results, 50\% (evidence range, 10\%-19\%; P {$<$} .001); breast cancer after negative mammography results, 5\% (evidence range, {$<$}0.05\%; P {$<$} .001); cardiac ischemia after negative stress test result, 5\% (evidence range, 0.43\%-2.5\%; P {$<$} .001); and urinary tract infection after negative urine culture result, 5\% (evidence range, 0\%-0.11\%; P {$<$} .001). Probability adjustments in response to test results varied from accurate to overestimates of risk by type of test (imputed median positive and negative likelihood ratios [LRs] for practitioners for chest radiography for pneumonia: positive LR, 4.8; evidence, 2.6; negative LR, 0.3; evidence, 0.3; mammography for breast cancer: positive LR, 44.3; evidence range, 13.0-33.0; negative LR, 1.0; evidence range, 0.05-0.24; exercise stress test for cardiac ischemia: positive LR, 21.0; evidence range, 2.0-2.7; negative LR, 0.6; evidence range, 0.5-0.6; urine culture for urinary tract infection: positive LR, 9.0; evidence, 9.0; negative LR, 0.1; evidence, 0.1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This survey study suggests that for common diseases and tests, practitioners overestimate the probability of disease before and after testing. Pretest probability was overestimated in all scenarios, whereas adjustment in probability after a positive or negative result varied by test. Widespread overestimates of the probability of disease likely contribute to overdiagnosis and overuse.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This survey study of attending and resident physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants was conducted in outpatient clinical settings in 8 US states from June 2018 to November 2019. The survey was an in-person, paper, 26-item survey in which clinicians were asked to estimate the probability of adverse disease outcomes and expected effects of therapies for diseases common in primary care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Estimated chance that treatments would benefit an individual patient. RESULTS Of 723 clinicians, 585 (81\%) responded, and 542 completed all the questions necessary for analysis, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 32 (29-44) years, 287 (53\%) women, and 294 (54\%) White participants. Clinicians consistently overestimated the chance that treatments would benefit an individual patient. The median (IQR) estimated chance that warfarin would prevent a stroke in the next year was 50\% (5\%-80\%) compared with scientific evidence, which indicates an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 0.2\% to 1.0\% based on a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 39\% to 50\%. The median (IQR) estimated chance that antihypertensive therapy would prevent a cardiovascular event within 5 years was 30\% (10\%-70\%) vs evidence of an ARR of 0\% to 3\% based on an RRR of 0\% to 28\%. The median (IQR) estimated chance that bisphosphonate therapy would prevent a hip fracture in the next 5 years was 40\% (10\%-60\%) vs evidence of ARR of 0.1\% to 0.4\% based on an RRR of 20\% to 40\%. The median (IQR) estimated chance that moderate-intensity statin therapy would prevent a cardiovascular event in the next 5 years was 20\% (IQR 5\%-50\%) vs evidence of an ARR of 0.3\% to 2\% based on an RRR of 19\% to 33\%. Estimates of the chance that a treatment would prevent an adverse outcome exceeded estimates of the absolute chance of that outcome for 60\% to 70\% of clinicians. Clinicians whose overestimations were greater were more likely to report using that treatment for patients in their practice (eg, use of warfarin: correlation coefficient, 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.40-0.53; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this survey study, clinicians significantly overestimated the benefits of treatment to individual patients. Clinicians with greater overestimates were more likely to report using treatments in actual patients.},

It focuses on DAGs' main uses, discusses central principles, and gives applied examples. DAGs are visual representations of qualitative causal assumptions: They encode researchers' beliefs about how the world works. Straightforward rules map these causal assumptions onto the associations and independencies in observable data. The two primary uses of DAGs are (1) determining the identifiability of causal effects from observed data and (2) deriving the testable implications of a causal model. Concepts covered in this chapter include identification, d-separation, confounding, endogenous selection, and overcontrol. Illustrative applications then demonstrate that conditioning on variables at any stage in a causal process can induce as well as remove bias, that confounding is a fundamentally causal rather than an associational concept, that conventional approaches to causal mediation analysis are often biased, and that causal inference in social networks inherently faces endogenous selection bias. The chapter discusses several graphical criteria for the identification of causal effects of single, time-point treatments (including the famous backdoor criterion), as well identification criteria for multiple, time-varying treatments.},

Methods: This was a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study at 4 academic medical centers and one community hospital. Adults (18 years or older) with nontraumatic spontaneous ICH, Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 or less, who did not have preexisting DNR orders were included. Results: One hundred nine subjects were enrolled. Mean age was 62 years; median Glasgow Coma Scale score was 7, and mean hematoma volume was 39 cm3. Based on ICH Score prediction, the expected overall 30-day mortality rate was 50\%. Observed mortality was substantially lower at 20.2\%, absolute average difference 29.8\% (95\% confidence interval: 21.5\%\textendash 37.7\%). At 90 days, 27.1\% had died, 21.5\% had a modified Rankin Scale score 5 5 (severe disability). A good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0\textendash 3) was achieved by 29.9\% and an additional 21.5\% fell into the moderately severe disability range (modified Rankin Scale score 5 4). Conclusions: Avoidance of early DNR orders along with guideline concordant ICH care results in substantially lower mortality than predicted. The observed functional outcomes in this study provide clinicians and families with data to determine the appropriate goals of treatment based on patients' wishes.

  abstract = {Objective: To validate various noncontrast CT (NCCT) predictors of hematoma expansion in a large international cohort of ICH patients and investigate whether intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment reduces ICH growth and improves outcome in patients with these markers. Methods: We analyzed patients enrolled in the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH-II) randomized controlled trial. Participants were assigned to intensive (systolic BP ,140 mm Hg) vs standard (systolic BP ,180 mm Hg) treatment within 4.5 hours from onset. The following NCCT markers were identified: intrahematoma hypodensities, black hole sign, swirl sign, blend sign, heterogeneous hematoma density, and irregular shape. ICH expansion was defined as hematoma growth .33\% and unfavorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score .3 at 90 days. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of ICH expansion and explore the association between NCCT signs and clinical benefit from intensive BP treatment. Results: A total of 989 patients were included (mean age 62 years, 61.9\% male), of whom 186/869 experienced hematoma expansion (21.4\%) and 361/952 (37.9\%) had unfavorable outcome. NCCT markers independently predicted ICH expansion (all p , 0.01) with overall accuracy ranging from 61\% to 78\% and good interrater reliability (k . 0.6 for all markers). There was no evidence of an interaction between NCCT markers and benefit from intensive BP reduction (all p for interaction .0.10). Conclusions: NCCT signs reliably identify ICH patients at high risk of hematoma growth. However, we found no evidence that patients with these markers specifically benefit from intensive BP reduction.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the spot sign is associated with ICH expansion across a wide range of centers and whether intensive BP reduction decreases hematoma expansion and improves outcome in patients with ICH and a spot sign. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS SCORE-IT (Spot Sign Score in Restricting ICH Growth) is a preplanned prospective observational study nested in the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH-II) randomized clinical trial. Participants included consecutive patients with primary ICH who underwent a CTA within 8 hours from onset at 59 sites from May 15, 2011, through December 19, 2015. Data were analyzed for the present study from July 1 to August 31, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patients in ATACH-II were randomized to intensive (systolic BP target, {$<$}140 mm Hg) vs standard (systolic BP target, {$<$}180 mm Hg) BP reduction within 4.5 hours from onset. Expansion of ICH was defined as hematoma growth of greater than 33\%, and an unfavorable outcome was defined as a 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 4 or greater (range, 0-6). The association among BP reduction, ICH expansion, and outcome was investigated with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 133 patients (83 men [62.4\%] and 50 women [37.6\%]; mean [SD] age, 61.9 [13.1] years) were included. Of these, 53 (39.8\%) had a spot sign, and 24 of 123 without missing data (19.5\%) experienced ICH expansion. The spot sign was associated with expansion with sensitivity of 0.54 (95\% CI, 0.34-0.74) and specificity of 0.63 (95\% CI, 0.53-0.72). After adjustment for potential confounders, intensive BP treatment was not associated with a significant reduction of ICH expansion (relative risk, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.27-2.51; P = .74) or improved outcome (relative risk of 90-day modified Rankin Scale score Ն4, 1.24; 95\% CI, 0.53-2.91; P = .62) in spot sign\textendash positive patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The predictive performance of the spot sign for ICH expansion was lower than in prior reports from single-center studies. No evidence suggested that patients with ICH and a spot sign specifically benefit from intensive BP reduction.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The practice of platelet transfusion to mitigate the deleterious effects of antiplatelet agents on spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains common. However, the effect of antiplatelet agents on patients with ICH is still controversial and transfusing platelets is not without risk. We performed a meta-analysis in order to determine the effect of platelet transfusion on antiplatelet agent associated ICH. METHODS: We queried PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases to identify cohort studies, case-control studies, and randomized control trials. Study quality was graded by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, as appropriate. Outcomes of interest included functional independence as measured by the modified Rankin Scale and mortality. We compared patients with antiplatelet agent associated ICH who received platelet transfusion to those that did not. RESULTS: We identified 625 articles. After reviewing 44 full text articles, 5 were deemed appropriate for meta-analysis, including 4 cohort studies and one randomized control trial. Considerable heterogeneity was present among the studies (I2~{$>~$}81\% for all analyses). We did not find a significant effect of platelet transfusions on functional independence (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.3, 95\% CI.0.45-3.9) or mortality (OR 0.58, 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.12-2.6). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence for an effect of platelet transfusions on functional independence or mortality following antiplatelet associated ICH. More randomized trials are needed to evaluate platelet transfusion in patients with ICH and proven reduced platelet activity or those requiring neurosurgical intervention.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Technology to restore the ability to communicate in paralyzed persons who cannot speak has the potential to improve autonomy and quality of life. An approach that decodes words and sentences directly from the cerebral cortical activity of such patients may represent an advancement over existing methods for assisted communication. METHODS We implanted a subdural, high-density, multielectrode array over the area of the sensorimotor cortex that controls speech in a person with anarthria (the loss of the ability to articulate speech) and spastic quadriparesis caused by a brain-stem stroke. Over the course of 48 sessions, we recorded 22 hours of cortical activity while the participant attempted to say individual words from a vocabulary set of 50 words. We used deep-learning algorithms to create computational models for the detection and classification of words from patterns in the recorded cortical activity. We applied these computational models, as well as a natural-language model that yielded next-word probabilities given the preceding words in a sequence, to decode full sentences as the participant attempted to say them.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Uncertainty persists over the effects of blood pressure lowering in acute intracerebral haemorrhage. We aimed to combine individual patient-level data from the two largest randomised controlled trials of blood pressure lowering strategies in patients with acute intracerebral haemorrhage to determine the strength of associations between key measures of systolic blood pressure control and safety and efficacy outcomes. METHODS: We did a preplanned pooled analysis of individual patient-level data acquired from the main phase of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Haemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2) and the second Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage (ATACH-II) trial. These trials included adult patients aged 19-99 years with spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral haemorrhage and elevated systolic blood pressure, without a clear indication or contraindication to treatment. Patients were excluded if they had a structural cerebral cause for the intracerebral haemorrhage, had a low score (3-5) on the Glasgow Coma Scale, or required immediate neurosurgery. Our primary analysis assessed the independent associations between three post-randomisation systolic blood pressure summary measures-magnitude of reduction in 1 h, mean achieved systolic blood pressure, and variability in systolic blood pressure between 1 h and 24 h-and the primary outcome of functional status, as defined by the distribution of scores on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days post-randomisation. We analysed the systolic blood pressure measures as continuous variables using generalised linear mixed models, adjusted for baseline covariables and trial. The primary and safety analyses were done in a modified intention-to-treat population, which only included patients with sufficient data on systolic blood pressure. FINDINGS: 3829 patients (mean age 63{$\cdot$}1 years [SD 12{$\cdot$}9], 1429 [37\%] women, and 2490 [65\%] Asian ethnicity) were randomly assigned in INTERACT2 and ATACH-II, with a median neurological impairment defined by scores on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of 11 (IQR 6-16) and median time from the onset of symptoms of intracerebral haemorrhage to randomisation of 3{$\cdot$}6 h (2{$\cdot$}7-4{$\cdot$}4). We excluded 20 patients with insufficient or no systolic blood pressure data, and we imputed missing systolic blood pressure data in 23 (1\%) of the remaining 3809 patients. Overall, the mean magnitude of early systolic blood pressure reduction was 29 mm Hg (SD 22), and subsequent mean systolic blood pressure achieved was 147 mm Hg (15) and variability in systolic blood pressure was 14 mm Hg (8). Achieved systolic blood pressure was continuously associated with functional status (improvement per 10 mm Hg increase adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0{$\cdot$}90 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}87-0{$\cdot$}94], p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Symptomatic hypotension occurred in 28 (1\%) patients, renal serious adverse events occurred in 26 (1\%) patients, and cardiac serious adverse events occurred in 99 (3\%) patients. INTERPRETATION: Our pooled analyses indicate that achieving early and stable systolic blood pressure seems to be safe and associated with favourable outcomes in patients with acute intracerebral haemorrhage of predominantly mild-to-moderate severity.

There are no trial data available about the net impact of early seizure prophylaxis on post-AIS survival. Methods: Using a stroke registry (American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines) individually linked to electronic health records, we examined the effect of initiating seizure prophylaxis (ie, epilepsy-specific antiseizure drugs) within 7 days of an AIS admission versus not initiating in patients {$\geq$}65 years admitted for a new, nonsevere AIS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Severity score {$\leq$}20) between 2014 and 2021 with no recorded use of epilepsy-specific antiseizure drugs in the previous 3 months. We addressed confounding by using inverse-probability weights. We performed standardization accounting for pertinent clinical and health care factors (eg, National Institutes of Health Stroke Severity scale, prescription counts, seizure-like events). Results: The study sample included 151 patients who received antiseizure drugs and 3020 who did not. The crude 30-day mortality risks were 219 deaths per 1000 patients among epilepsy-specific antiseizure drugs initiators and 120 deaths per 1000 among noninitiators. After standardization, the estimated mortality was 251 (95\% CI, 190\textendash 307) deaths per 1000 among initiators and 120 (95\% CI, 86\textendash 144) deaths per 1000 among noninitiators, corresponding to a risk difference of 131 (95\% CI, 65\textendash 200) excess deaths per 1000 patients. In the prespecified subgroup analyses, the risk difference was 52 (95\% CI, 11\textendash 72) among patients with minor AIS and 138 (95\% CI, 52\textendash 222) among moderate-to-severe AIS patients. Similarly, the risk differences were 86 (95\% CI, 18\textendash 118) and 157 (95\% CI, 57\textendash 219) among patients aged 65 to 74 years and {$\geq$}75 years, respectively. Conclusions: There was a higher risk of 30-day mortality associated with initiating versus not initiating seizure prophylaxis within 7 days post-AIS. This study does not support the role of seizure prophylaxis in reducing 30-day poststroke mortality.},

Furthermore, as data quantity continues to increase in today's era of big data, the paradox is becoming more pernicious.

  abstract = {Background and Objectives Breakdowns in clinician-family communication in neurologic intensive care units (neuroICUs) are common, particularly for goals-of-care decisions to continue or withdraw life-sustaining treatments while considering long-term prognoses. Shared decision-making interventions (decision aids [DAs]) may prevent this problem and increase patient-centered care, yet none are currently available. We assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived usefulness of a DA for goals-of-care communication with surrogate decision makers for critically ill patients with severe acute brain injury (SABI) after hemispheric acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or traumatic brain injury. Methods We conducted a parallel-arm, unblinded, patient-level randomized, controlled pilot trial at 2 tertiary care US neuroICUs and randomized surrogate participants 1:1 to a tailored paper-based DA provided to surrogates before clinician-family goals-of-care meetings or usual care (no intervention before clinician-family meetings). The primary outcomes were feasibility of deploying the DA (recruitment, participation, and retention), acceptability, and perceived usefulness of the DA among surrogates. Exploratory outcomes included outcome of surrogate goals-of-care decision, code status changes during admission, patients' 3-month functional outcome, and surrogates' 3-month validated psychological outcomes. Results We approached 83 surrogates of 58 patients and enrolled 66 surrogates of 41 patients (80\% consent rate). Of 66 surrogates, 45 remained in the study at 3 months (68\% retention). Of the 33 surrogates randomized to intervention, 27 were able to receive the DA, and 25 subsequently read the DA (93\% participation). Eighty-two percent rated the DA's acceptability as good or excellent (median acceptability score 2 [IQR 2\textendash 3]); 96\% found it useful for goals-of-care decision making. In the DA group, there was a trend toward fewer comfort care decisions (27\% vs 56\%, p = 0.1) and fewer code status changes (no change, 73\% vs 44\%, p = 0.02). At 3 months, fewer patients in the DA group had died (33\% vs 69\%, p = 0.05; median Glasgow Outcome Scale 3 vs1, p = 0.05). Regardless of intervention, 3-month psychological outcomes were significantly worse among surrogates who had chosen continuation of care. Discussion A goals-of-care DA to support ICU shared decision making for patients with SABI is feasible to deploy and well perceived by surrogates. A larger trial is feasible to conduct, although surrogates who select continuation of care deserve additional psychosocial support. Clinical Trials Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03833375. Classification of Evidence This study provides Class IV evidence that the use of a DA explaining the goals-of-care decision and the treatment options is acceptable and useful to surrogates of incapacitated critically ill patients with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or traumatic brain injury.},

  abstract = {the most common and potentially life-threatening neurologic and medical complications to promote their early recognition and prevent secondary brain injury. RECENT FINDINGS  Over the past 30 years, the incidence of SAH has remained stable; yet, likely because of improved care in specialized neurocritical care units, discharge mortality has considerably decreased. Two consensus guidelines by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association and the Neurocritical Care Society have outlined best practices for the management of patients with SAH. The most important recommendations include admission of patients to high-volume centers (defined as more than 35 SAH admissions per year) under the management of a multidisciplinary, specialized team; expeditious identification and treatment of the bleeding source with evaluation by a multidisciplinary team consisting of cerebrovascular neurosurgeons, neuroendovascular specialists, and neurointensivists; management of patients in a neurocritical care unit with enteral nimodipine, blood pressure control, euvolemia, and close monitoring for neurologic and medical complications; and treatment of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm/delayed cerebral ischemia with induced hypertension and endovascular therapies. This article also highlights new insights of SAH pathophysiology and provides updates in the management approach. SUMMARY  SAH remains a neurologic emergency. Management of patients with SAH includes adherence to published guidelines, but some areas of SAH management remain understudied. Clinical trials are required to elucidate the role of these controversial management approaches in improving patient outcomes....},

  abstract = {Background: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies are frequently performed, but no widely accepted guidance is available at present. We performed a systematic scoping review of published methodological recommendations on how to systematically review and meta-analyse observational studies. Methods: We searched online databases and websites and contacted experts in the field to locate potentially eligible articles. We included articles that provided any type of recommendation on how to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies. We extracted and summarised recommendations on pre-defined key items: protocol development, research question, search strategy, study eligibility, data extraction, dealing with different study designs, risk of bias assessment, publication bias, heterogeneity, statistical analysis. We summarised recommendations by key item, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement as well as areas where recommendations were missing or scarce. Results: The searches identified 2461 articles of which 93 were eligible. Many recommendations for reviews and metaanalyses of observational studies were transferred from guidance developed for reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs. Although there was substantial agreement in some methodological areas there was also considerable disagreement on how evidence synthesis of observational studies should be conducted. Conflicting recommendations were seen on topics such as the inclusion of different study designs in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the use of quality scales to assess the risk of bias, and the choice of model (e.g. fixed vs. random effects) for meta-analysis. Conclusion: There is a need for sound methodological guidance on how to conduct systematic reviews and metaanalyses of observational studies, which critically considers areas in which there are conflicting recommendations.},

However, the representativeness of these samples may be limited\textendash either through selection into studies, or by attrition from studies over time. Here we explore the potential impact of this selection bias on results obtained from these studies, from the perspective that this amounts to conditioning on a collider (i.e. a form of collider bias). Whereas it is acknowledged that selection bias will have a strong effect on representativeness and prevalence estimates, it is often assumed that it should not have a strong impact on estimates of associations. We argue that because selection can induce collider bias (which occurs when two variables independently influence a third variable, and that third variable is conditioned upon), selection can lead to substantially biased estimates of associations. In particular, selection related to phenotypes can bias associations with genetic variants associated with those phenotypes. In simulations, we show that even modest influences on selection into, or attrition from, a study can generate biased and potentially misleading estimates of both phenotypic and genotypic associations. Our results highlight the value of knowing which population your study sample is representative of. If the factors influencing selection and attrition are known, they can be adjusted for. For example, having DNA available on most participants in a birth cohort study offers the possibility of investigating the extent to which polygenic scores predict subsequent participation, which in turn would enable sensitivity analyses of the extent to which bias might distort estimates.},

Whilst many new ways of working and emerging innovations hold a great deal of promise, it will be important to invest in meta-research activity to ensure that these approaches are evidence based, work as intended, and do not have unintended consequences. Addressing reproducibility will require working collaboratively across the research ecosystem to share best practice and to make the most effective use of resources. The UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN) brings together Local Networks of researchers, Institutions, and External Stakeholders (funders, publishers, learned societies and other sectoral organisations), to coordinate action on reproducibility and work to ensure the UK retains its place as a centre for world-leading research. This activity is coordinated by the UKRN Steering Group. We consider this structure as valuable, bringing together a range of voices at a range of levels to support the combined efforts required to enact change.},

Individual trial and cumulative FI analyses were serially conducted after each successive randomized controlled trial (RCT). FI scores were classified as follows: not robust (FI 0\textendash 4), somewhat robust (FI 5\textendash 12), robust (FI 13\textendash 33), and highly robust (FI {$>$}33). Results: Nine randomized controlled trials were identified from 1995 to 2021 of within-3-hour intravenous alteplase for acute ischemic stroke. In study-level meta-analyses, alteplase increased freedom-from-disability outcome (mRS score 0\textendash 1), 31.0\% versus 22.3\%, relative risk, 1.39 (95\% CI, 1.20\textendash 1.61); P{$<$}0.00001; increased functional independence (mRS score 0\textendash 2), 39.7\% versus 31.2\%, relative risk, 1.29 (95\% CI, 1.14\textendash 1.45), P{$<$}0.000; and did not alter mortality, 24.1\% versus 26.1\%; P=0.23. Overall FIs for study-level meta-analyses were both highly robust at 42 and 40 for mRS score 0\textendash 1 and mRS score 0\textendash 2, respectively.

Given that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate for years to come, school closures may be debated again. As familiar respiratory viruses have returned, their combined pressure alongside COVID-19 caused renewed discussion of closures in the UK and initiation of remote learning in areas of the USA in the winter of 2022.1 2 This suggests that debates around school closures will continue into the future. According to the Oxford COVID-19 policy tracker,3 school closures around the world were rapid and nearly uniform in March 2020. In contrast, the reopening process was much more variable, with different countries using different metrics and criteria to reopen. According to our analysis, the variability in duration of school closures between January 2020 and December 2021 was extreme. A handful of countries had zero days (including Burundi, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan), while Brazil, Panama, Peru and Ukraine required some level of closure for a total of 660 days, and Saudi Arabia for 663 days (figures 1 and 2). These differences highlight the lack of consensus about the efficacy of school closures on reducing COVID-19 deaths.

Figure 2  Geographical representation of the number of days of required school closure (Oxford COVID-19 policy tracker score 2 or 3). At the start of the pandemic, the justifications of closing schools included a combination of `first principles' (anything reducing social contact is valuable) and drawing on previous evidence based on influenza outbreaks.4 Such interventions have their origins in complex historical precedent, social and medical circumstances.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Observational data suggest that antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) alleviates thromboembolic risk without increasing the risk of recurrent ICH. Given the paucity of data on the relationship between antiplatelet therapy after ICH and functional outcomes, we aimed to study this association in a multicenter cohort. Methods\textemdash We meta-analyzed data from (1) the Massachusetts General Hospital ICH registry (n=1854), (2) the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive database (n=762), and (3) the Yale stroke registry (n=185). Our exposure was antiplatelet therapy after ICH, which was modeled as a time-varying covariate. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and a composite of major disability or death (modified Rankin Scale score 4\textendash 6). We used Cox proportional regression analyses to estimate the hazard ratio of death or poor functional outcome as a function of antiplatelet therapy and random-effects meta-analysis to pool the estimated HRs across studies. Additional analyses stratified by hematoma location (lobar and deep ICH) were performed. Results\textemdash We included a total of 2801 ICH patients, of whom 288 (10.3\%) were started on antiplatelet medications after ICH. Median times to antiplatelet therapy ranged from 7 to 39 days. Antiplatelet therapy after ICH was not associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.66\textendash 1.09), or death or major disability (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.59\textendash 1.16) compared with patients not started on antiplatelet therapy. Similar results were obtained in additional analyses stratified by hematoma location. Conclusions\textemdash Antiplatelet therapy after ICH appeared safe and was not associated with all-cause mortality or functional outcome, regardless of hematoma location. Randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the effects and harms of antiplatelet therapy after ICH.\hspace{0.6em}\,{$\mkern1mu$}(Stroke. 2019;50:3057-3063.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the associations of anticoagulation resumption with the subsequent risk of ICH recurrence and thromboembolism. Methods\textemdash We searched published medical literature to identify cohort studies involving adults with anticoagulationassociated ICH. Our predictor variable was resumption of anticoagulation.

After assessing study heterogeneity and publication bias, we performed a meta-analysis using random-effects models to assess the strength of association between anticoagulation resumption and our outcomes. Results\textemdash Eight studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, with 5306 ICH patients. Almost all studies evaluated anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Thromboembolic disease is common in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). There is limited evidence on the association of in-hospital anticoagulation (AC) with outcomes and postmortem findings. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to examine association of AC with in-hospital outcomes and describe thromboembolic findings on autopsies. METHODS This retrospective analysis examined the association of AC with mortality, intubation, and major bleeding. Subanalyses were also conducted on the association of therapeutic versus prophylactic AC initiated \#48 h from admission. Thromboembolic disease was contextualized by premortem AC among consecutive autopsies. RESULTS Among 4,389 patients, median age was 65 years with 44\% women. Compared with no AC (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1,530; 34.9\%), therapeutic AC (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 900; 20.5\%) and prophylactic AC (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1,959; 44.6\%) were associated with lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.53; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45 to 0.62 and aHR: 0.50; 95\% CI: 0.45 to 0.57, respectively), and intubation (aHR: 0.69; 95\% CI: 0.51 to 0.94 and aHR: 0.72; 95\% CI: 0.58 to 0.89, respectively). When initiated \#48 h from admission, there was no statistically significant difference between therapeutic (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 766) versus prophylactic AC (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1,860) (aHR: 0.86; 95\% CI: 0.73 to 1.02; p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.08). Overall, 89 patients (2\%) had major bleeding adjudicated by clinician review, with 27 of 900 (3.0\%) on therapeutic, 33 of 1,959 (1.7\%) on prophylactic, and 29 of 1,530 (1.9\%) on no AC. Of 26 autopsies, 11 (42\%) had thromboembolic disease not clinically suspected and 3 of 11 (27\%) were on therapeutic AC. CONCLUSIONS AC was associated with lower mortality and intubation among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Compared with prophylactic AC, therapeutic AC was associated with lower mortality, although not statistically significant. Autopsies revealed frequent thromboembolic disease. These data may inform trials to determine optimal AC regimens.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Early seizures are a common complication of intracerebral hemorrhage, occurring in \textasciitilde 10\% of patients. However, the independent effect of early seizures on patient outcomes, particularly health-related quality of life, is unclear. Without a potential benefit to patient outcomes, the widespread use (\textasciitilde 40\%) of prophylactic seizure medications has no reasonable chance of improving patient outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that health-related quality of life at follow-up is different between patients with and without early seizures (and secondarily, with nonconvulsive status epilepticus) after intracerebral hemorrhage. DESIGN: Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were enrolled in an observational cohort study that prospectively collected clinical data and health-related quality of life at follow-up. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: One-hundred thirty-three patients whose health-related quality of life was assessed 3 months after intracerebral hemorrhage onset. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Health-related quality of life was obtained at 3 months after intracerebral hemorrhage onset. T Scores of health-related quality of life were modeled with multivariable linear models accounting for severity with the intracerebral hemorrhage Score and hematoma location. Health-related quality of life was measured with National Institutes of Health Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System/Neuroquality of life, expressed in T Scores (U.S. normal 50 {$\pm$} 10). The modified Rankin Scale (a global measure) was a secondary outcome. There were 12 patients (9\%) with early seizures. T Scores of health-related quality of life at follow-up were lower (worse) in patients with early seizure compared with patients without an early seizure (44 [32.75\textendash 51.85] vs 30.25 [18.9\textendash 39.15]; p = 0.04); results for other domains of health-related quality of life were similar. The association persisted in multivariable models. There was no association between early seizures and prophylactic seizure medications (p = 0.4). Results for patients with nonconvulsive status epilepticus were similar. There was no association between early seizures and the modified Rankin Scale at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Early seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus were associated with lower health-related quality of life at follow-up in survivors of intracerebral hemorrhage.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the deadliest form of stroke. In observational studies, lower serum magnesium has been linked to more hematoma expansion (HE) and intracranial hemorrhage, implying that supplemental magnesium sulfate is a potential acute treatment for patients with ICH and could reduce HE. FAST-MAG (Field Administration of Stroke Therapy - Magnesium) was a clinical trial of magnesium sulfate started prehospital in patients with acute stroke within 2 hours of last known well enrolled. CT was not required prior to enrollment, and several hundred patients with acute ICH were enrolled. In this ancillary analysis, we assessed the effect of magnesium sulfate treatment upon HE in patients with acute ICH. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data that were prospectively collected in the FAST-MAG study. Patients received intravenous magnesium sulfate or matched placebo within 2 hours of onset. We compared HE among patients allocated to intravenous magnesium sulfate or placebo with a Mann-Whitney U. We used the same method to compare neurological deficit severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) and global disability (modified Rankin Scale) at 3 months. RESULTS: Among 268 patients with ICH meeting study entry criteria, mean 65.4{$\pm$}13/4 years, 33\% were female, and 211 (79\%) had a history of hypertension. Initial deficit severities were median (interquartile range) of 4 (3\textendash 5) on the Los Angeles Motor Scale in the field and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 16 (9.5\textendash 25.5) early after hospital arrival. Follow-up brain imaging was performed a median of 17.1 (11.3\textendash 22.7) hours after first scan. The magnesium and placebo groups did not statistically differ in hematoma volume on arrival, 10.1 (5.6\textendash 28.7) versus 12.4 (5.6\textendash 28.7) mL (P=0.6), or HE, 2.0 (0.1\textendash 7.4) versus 1.5 (-0.2 to 8) mL (P=0.5). There was no difference in functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score of 3\textendash 6), 59\% versus 50\% (P=0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium sulfate did not reduce HE or improve functional outcomes at 90 days. A benefit for patients with initial hypomagnesemia was not addressed.},

  abstract = {When patients become seriously ill, clinicians must engage in difficult conversations to ensure that the care provided aligns with patient expectations, goals and values. In these situations, clinicians tend to focus on medical facts, present treatment options like choices on a restaurant menu, give detailed explanations for each option and request that patients or surrogates choose among them by asking `What do you want?' or `What would they want?' While these questions are well intentioned, they are seldom productive. The use of the word `want' shifts the discussion from attainable goals and values to magical outcomes not grounded in medical feasibility and specific treatment options, such as dialysis or intubation.1 Yet, it is hard for patients and their surrogates to imagine what those treatment options realistically entail, and the resulting decisions are likely to be ill informed and goal discordant. Instead, clinicians are encouraged to explore patients' values and priorities and make a recommendation based on them.2 3 Unfortunately, despite many serious illness conversation roadmaps,2 4 few guidelines exist for how to actually explore values. In this article, we provide suggestions for this crucial step in a serious illness conversation. Values are broad concepts that guide our actions and may include values of \ldots},

  abstract = {Objectives: To update the Society of Critical Care Medicine's guidelines for ICU admission, discharge, and triage, providing a framework for clinical practice, the development of institutional policies, and further research. Design: An appointed Task Force followed a standard, systematic, and evidence-based approach in reviewing the literature to develop these guidelines. Measurements and Main Results: The assessment of the evidence and recommendations was based on the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. The general subject was addressed in sections: admission criteria and benefits of different levels of care, triage, discharge timing and strategies, use of outreach programs to supplement ICU care, quality assurance\&sol;improvement and metrics, nonbeneficial treatment in the ICU, and rationing considerations. The literature searches yielded 2,404 articles published from January 1998 to October 2013 for review. Following the appraisal of the literature, discussion, and consensus, recommendations were written. Conclusion: Although these are administrative guidelines, the subjects addressed encompass complex ethical and medico-legal aspects of patient care that affect daily clinical practice. A limited amount of high-quality evidence made it difficult to answer all the questions asked related to ICU admission, discharge, and triage. Despite these limitations, the members of the Task Force believe that these recommendations provide a comprehensive framework to guide practitioners in making informed decisions during the admission, discharge, and triage process as well as in resolving issues of nonbeneficial treatment and rationing. We need to further develop preventive strategies to reduce the burden of critical illness, educate our noncritical care colleagues about these interventions, and improve our outreach, developing early identification and intervention systems.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Salt substitutes with reduced sodium levels and increased potassium levels have been shown to lower blood pressure, but their effects on cardiovascular and safety outcomes are uncertain. METHODS We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial involving persons from 600 villages in rural China. The participants had a history of stroke or were 60 years of age or older and had high blood pressure. The villages were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention group, in which the participants used a salt substitute (75\% sodium chloride and 25\% potassium chloride by mass), or to the control group, in which the participants continued to use regular salt (100\% sodium chloride). The primary outcome was stroke, the secondary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events and death from any cause, and the safety outcome was clinical hyperkalemia. RESULTS A total of 20,995 persons were enrolled in the trial. The mean age of the participants was 65.4 years, and 49.5\% were female, 72.6\% had a history of stroke, and 88.4\% a history of hypertension. The mean duration of follow-up was 4.74 years. The rate of stroke was lower with the salt substitute than with regular salt (29.14 events vs. 33.65 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.86; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 0.96; P\,=\,0.006), as were the rates of major cardiovascular events (49.09 events vs. 56.29 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.80 to 0.94; P{$<$}0.001) and death (39.28 events vs. 44.61 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 0.95; P{$<$}0.001). The rate of serious adverse events attributed to hyperkalemia was not significantly higher with the salt substitute than with regular salt (3.35 events vs. 3.30 events per 1000 person-years; rate ratio, 1.04; 95\% CI, 0.80 to 1.37; P\,=\,0.76).

It scores our communication, giving us vivid and quantified feedback, via Likes, Retweets, and Follower counts. But this gamification doesn't just increase our motivation to communicate; it changes the very nature of the activity. Games are more satisfying than ordinary life precisely because game goals are simpler, cleaner, and easier to apply. Twitter is thrilling precisely because its goals have been artificially clarified and narrowed. When we buy into Twitter's gamification, then our values shift from the complex and pluralistic values of communication to the narrower quest for popularity and virality. Twitter's gamification bears some resemblance with the phenomena of echo chambers and moral outrage porn. In all these phenomena, we are instrumentalizing our ends for hedonistic reasons. We have shifted our aims in an activity, not because the new aims are more valuable, but in exchange for extra pleasure.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare the clinical outcomes of patients selected for mechanical thrombectomy by noncontrast computed tomography (CT) vs those selected by computed tomography perfusion (CTP) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the extended time window. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multinational cohort study included consecutive patients with proximal anterior circulation occlusion stroke presenting within 6 to 24 hours of time last seen well from January 2014 to December 2020. This study was conducted at 15 sites across 5 countries in Europe and North America. The duration of follow-up was 90 days from stroke onset. EXPOSURES Computed tomography with Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, CTP, or MRI. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the distribution of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 90 days (ordinal shift). Secondary outcomes included the rates of 90-day functional independence (mRS scores of 0-2), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and 90-day mortality. RESULTS Of 2304 patients screened for eligibility, 1604 patients were included, with a median (IQR) age of 70 (59-80) years; 848 (52.9\%) were women. A total of 534 patients were selected to undergo mechanical thrombectomy by CT, 752 by CTP, and 318 by MRI. After adjustment of confounders, there was no difference in 90-day ordinal mRS shift between patients selected by CT vs CTP (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.95 [95\% CI, 0.77-1.17]; P = .64) or CT vs MRI (aOR, 0.95 [95\% CI, 0.8-1.13]; P = .55). The rates of 90-day functional independence (mRS scores 0-2 vs 3-6) were similar between patients selected by CT vs CTP (aOR, 0.90 [95\% CI, 0.7-1.16]; P = .42) but lower in patients selected by MRI than CT (aOR, 0.79 [95\% CI, 0.64-0.98]; P = .03). Successful reperfusion was more common in the CT and CTP groups compared with the MRI group (474 [88.9\%] and 670 [89.5\%] vs 250 [78.9\%]; P {$<$} .001). No significant differences in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (CT, 42 [8.1\%]; CTP, 43 [5.8\%]; MRI, 15 [4.7\%]; P = .11) or 90-day mortality (CT, 125 [23.4\%]; CTP, 159 [21.1\%]; MRI, 62 [19.5\%]; P = .38) were observed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients undergoing proximal anterior circulation mechanical thrombectomy in the extended time window, there were no significant differences in the clinical outcomes of patients selected with noncontrast CT compared with those selected with CTP or MRI. These findings have the potential to widen the indication for treating patients in the extended window using a simpler and more widespread noncontrast CT\textendash only paradigm.},

We determined resource utilization of patients accepted from outside hospitals compared with patients directly arriving to our center.MethodsFrom our stroke registry, we compared patients with primary ICH transferred to those directly arriving to our CSC from March 2011-March 2012. We compared the proportion of patients who utilized at least one of these resources: neurointensive care unit (NICU), neurosurgical intervention, or clinical trial enrollment.ResultsAmong the 362 patients, 210 (58\%) were transfers. Transferred patients were older, had higher median Glasgow Coma Scale scores, and lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores than directly admitted patients. Transfers had smaller median ICH volumes (20.5\,cc versus 15.2\,cc; P\,=\,.04) and lower ICH scores (2.1\,{$\pm$}\,1.4 versus 1.6\,{$\pm$}\,1.3; P\,{$<$}\,.01). A smaller proportion of transfers utilized CSC-specific resources compared with direct admits (P\,=\,.02). Fewer transferred patients required neurosurgical intervention or were enrolled in trials. No significant difference was found in the proportion of patients who used NICU resources, although transferred patients had a significantly lower length of stay in the NICU. Average hospital stay costs were less for transferred patients than for direct admits.ConclusionsPatients with ICH transferred to our CSC underwent fewer neurosurgical procedures and had a shorter stay in the NICU. These results were reflected in the lower per-patient costs in the transferred group. Our results raise the need to analyze cost\textendash benefits and resource utilization of transferring patients with milder ICH.}

  abstract = {Background and Objectives There is significant heterogeneity in the reporting of outcome measures in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) research. The modified Rankin scale (mRS) is the most commonly reported functional outcome measure. The mRS focuses on physical disability; however, many aSAH survivors experience sequalae in other domains, and the mRS may therefore not capture outcomes important to aSAH survivors. The objective of this study was to assess the clinical relevance of the mRS as a research outcome measure to people with lived aSAH experience. Methods We conducted an international cross-sectional survey of 355 aSAH survivors, family members, and caregivers to evaluate patient-perceived outcomes in relation to the mRS. The mRS was assessed using a previously validated web-based tool. Results Response rate was 60\%; respondents from 7 continents were composed of 86\% aSAH survivors and 14\% family members/caregivers. Agreement between self-assessed outcome and the mRS was poor (Kappa 0.26 [CI 0.14\textendash 0.39]). Of the 172 respondents who self-assessed as having had a good aSAH outcome, 122 (71\%) had a score of 0\textendash 2 on the mRS. Approximately 19\% of respondents with a good outcome, based on a measured mRS score of 0\textendash 2, self-assessed as having had a poor aSAH outcome. When the mRS score was dichotomized as 0\textendash 3 corresponding to a good outcome, agreement between the score and self-assessed outcome remained poor with a Kappa score of 0.40 (CI 0.20\textendash 0.60). Approximately 30\% of respondents believed that the mRS should not be used as an outcome measure in future aSAH trials. Discussion The findings suggest that there is poor agreement between aSAH survivors' self-assessed outcome, their actual mRS score, and the dichotomization of the mRS score into good/poor outcomes. Patient-centered and patient-informed outcome measurement tools are needed to guide the aSAH research agenda.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash{} Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most lethal stroke types. In December 2003, a National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop was convened to develop a consensus for ICH research priorities. The focus was clinical research aimed at acute ICH in patients. Methods\textemdash{} Workshop participants were divided into 6 groups: (1) current state of ICH research; (2) basic science; and (3) imaging, (4) medical, (5) surgical, and (6) clinical methodology. Each group formulated research priorities before the workshop. At the workshop, these were discussed and refined. Results\textemdash{} Recent progress in management of hemorrhage growth, intraventricular hemorrhage, and limitations in the benefit of open craniotomy were noted. The workshop identified the importance of developing animal models to reflect human ICH, as well as the phenomena of rebleeding. More human ICH pathology is needed. Real-time, high-field magnets and 3-dimensional imaging, as well as high-resolution tissue probes, are ICH imaging priorities. Trials of acute blood pressure\textendash lowering in ICH and coagulopathy reversal are medical priorities. The exact role of edema in human ICH pathology and its treatment requires intensive study. Trials of minimally invasive surgical techniques including mechanical and chemical surgical adjuncts are critically important. The methodologic challenges include establishing research networks and a multi-specialty approach. Waiver of consent issues and standardizing care in trials are important issues. Encouragement of young investigators from varied backgrounds to enter the ICH research field is critical. Conclusions\textemdash{} Increasing ICH research is crucial. A collaborative approach is likely to yield therapies for this devastating form of brain injury.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of combination subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab on progression from early asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection to symptomatic COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of close household contacts of a SARS-CoV-2\textendash infected index case at 112 sites in the US, Romania, and Moldova enrolled July 13, 2020\textendash January 28, 2021; follow-up ended March 11, 2021. Asymptomatic individuals (aged Ն12 years) were eligible if identified within 96 hours of index case positive test collection. Results from 314 individuals positive on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase\textendash quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing are reported. INTERVENTIONS Individuals were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 dose of subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab, 1200 mg (600 mg of each; n = 158), or placebo (n = 156). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the proportion of seronegative participants who developed symptomatic COVID-19 during the 28-day efficacy assessment period. The key secondary efficacy end points were the number of weeks of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and the number of weeks of high viral load ({$>$}4 log10 copies/mL). RESULTS Among 314 randomized participants (mean age, 41.0 years; 51.6\% women), 310 (99.7\%) completed the efficacy assessment period; 204 were asymptomatic and seronegative at baseline and included in the primary efficacy analysis. Subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab, 1200 mg, significantly prevented progression to symptomatic disease (29/100 [29.0\%] vs 44/104 [42.3\%] with placebo; odds ratio, 0.54 [95\% CI, 0.30-0.97]; P = .04; absolute risk difference, -13.3\% [95\% CI, -26.3\% to -0.3\%]). Casirivimab and imdevimab reduced the number of symptomatic weeks per 1000 participants (895.7 weeks vs 1637.4 weeks with placebo; P = .03), an approximately 5.6-day reduction in symptom duration per symptomatic participant. Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab also reduced the number of high viral load weeks per 1000 participants (489.8 weeks vs 811.9 weeks with placebo; P = .001). The proportion of participants receiving casirivimab and imdevimab who had 1 or more treatment-emergent adverse event was 33.5\% vs 48.1\% for placebo, including events related (25.8\% vs 39.7\%) or not related (11.0\% vs 16.0\%) to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR\textendash positive individuals living with an infected household contact, treatment with subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab antibody combination vs placebo significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 over 28 days.},

The primary efficacy end point was the development of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection through day 28 in participants who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection (as measured by reverse-transcriptase\textendash quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay) or previous immunity (seronegativity). RESULTS Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection developed in 11 of 753 participants in the REGEN-COV group (1.5\%) and in 59 of 752 participants in the placebo group (7.8\%) (relative risk reduction [1 minus the relative risk], 81.4\%; P{$<$}0.001). In weeks 2 to 4, a total of 2 of 753 participants in the REGEN-COV group (0.3\%) and 27 of 752 participants in the placebo group (3.6\%) had symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (relative risk reduction, 92.6\%). REGEN-COV also prevented symptomatic and asymptomatic infections overall (relative risk reduction, 66.4\%). Among symptomatic infected participants, the median time to resolution of symptoms was 2 weeks shorter with REGEN-COV than with placebo (1.2 weeks and 3.2 weeks, respectively), and the duration of a high viral load ({$>$}104 copies per milliliter) was shorter (0.4 weeks and 1.3 weeks, respectively). No dose-limiting toxic effects of REGEN-COV were noted. CONCLUSIONS Subcutaneous REGEN-COV prevented symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously uninfected household contacts of infected persons. Among the participants who became infected, REGEN-COV reduced the duration of symptomatic disease and the duration of a high viral load.

DESIGN: A consensus committee comprising 22 international experts met in October 2016 during ESICM LIVES2016. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussions between the members of the committee subsequently served to discuss and develop the consensus process. METHODS: Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were reviewed and updated as needed, and evidence profiles generated. The consensus focused on three main topics: (1) general fluid resuscitation and maintenance in neurointensive care patients, (2) hyperosmolar fluids for intracranial pressure control, (3) fluid management in delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid haemorrhage. After an extensive literature search, the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system were applied to assess the quality of evidence (from high to very low), to formulate treatment recommendations as strong or weak, and to issue best practice statements when applicable. A modified Delphi process based on the integration of evidence provided by the literature and expert opinions-using a sequential approach to avoid biases and misinterpretations-was used to generate the final consensus statement. RESULTS: The final consensus comprises a total of 32 statements, including 13 strong recommendations and 17 weak recommendations. No recommendations were provided for two statements. CONCLUSIONS: We present a consensus statement and clinical practice recommendations on fluid therapy for neurointensive care patients.},

  abstract = {The term ``interference'' has been used to describe any setting in which one subject's exposure may affect another subject's outcome. We use causal diagrams to distinguish among three causal mechanisms that give rise to interference. The first causal mechanism by which interference can operate is a direct causal effect of one individual's treatment on another individual's outcome; we call this direct interference. Interference by contagion is present when one individual's outcome may affect the outcomes of other individuals with whom he comes into contact. Then giving treatment to the first individual could have an indirect effect on others through the treated individual's outcome. The third pathway by which interference may operate is allocational interference. Treatment in this case allocates individuals to groups; through interactions within a group, individuals may affect one another's outcomes in any number of ways. In many settings, more than one type of interference will be present simultaneously. The causal effects of interest differ according to which types of interference are present, as do the conditions under which causal effects are identifiable. Using causal diagrams for interference, we describe these differences, give criteria for the identification of important causal effects, and discuss applications to infectious diseases.},

We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of early versus delayed initiation of NOAC in these patients. Methods: TIMING (Timing of Oral Anticoagulant Therapy in Acute Ischemic Stroke With Atrial Fibrillation) was a registry-based, randomized, noninferiority, open-label, blinded end-point study at 34 stroke units using the Swedish Stroke Register for enrollment and follow-up. Within 72 hours from stroke onset, patients were randomized to early ({$\leq$}4 days) or delayed (5\textendash 10 days) NOAC initiation, with choice of NOAC at the investigators' discretion. The primary outcome was the composite of recurrent ischemic stroke, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, or all-cause mortality at 90 days. The prespecified noninferiority margin was 3\%. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome. Results: Between April 2, 2017, and December 30, 2020, 888 patients were randomized to either early (n=450) or delayed (n=438) initiation of NOAC. No patient was lost to 90-day follow-up. Mean age was 78.3 years (SD, 9.9 years); 46.2\% were women; 49.1\% had previously known atrial fibrillation; and 17.5\% prior stroke. The primary outcome occurred in 31 patients (6.89\%) assigned to early initiation and in 38 patients (8.68\%) assigned to delayed NOAC initiation (absolute risk difference, -1.79\% [95\% CI, -5.31\% to 1.74\%]; Pnoninferiority=0.004). Ischemic stroke rates were 3.11\% and 4.57\% (risk difference, -1.46\% [95\% CI, -3.98\% to 1.07\%]) and all-cause mortality rates were 4.67\% and 5.71\% (risk difference, -1.04\% [95\% CI, -3.96\% to 1.88\%]) in the early and delayed groups, respectively. No patient in either group experienced symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Conclusions: Early initiation was noninferior to delayed start of NOAC after acute ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Numerically lower rates of ischemic stroke and death and the absence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages implied that the early start of NOAC was safe and should be considered for acute secondary stroke prevention in patients eligible for NOAC treatment.

  abstract = {Objective:~         The developmental pipeline for novel therapeutics to treat sepsis has diminished to a trickle compared to previous years of sepsis research. While enormous strides have been made in understanding the basic molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathophysiology of sepsis, a long list of novel agents have now been tested in clinical trials without a single immunomodulating therapy showing consistent benefit. The only antisepsis agent to successfully complete a phase III clinical trial was human recumbent activated protein C. This drug was taken off the market after a follow-up placebo-controlled trial (human recombinant activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation of Severe Sepsis and septic Shock [PROWESS SHOCK]) failed to replicate the favorable results of the initial registration trial performed ten years earlier. We must critically reevaluate our basic approach to the preclinical and clinical evaluation of new sepsis therapies.         Data Sources:~         We selected the major clinical studies that investigated interventional trials with novel therapies to treat sepsis over the last 30 years.         Study Selection:~         Phase II and phase III trials investigating new treatments for sepsis and editorials and critiques of these studies.         Data Extraction:~         Selected manuscripts and clinical study reports were analyzed from sepsis trials. Specific shortcomings and potential pit falls in preclinical evaluation and clinical study design and analysis were reviewed and synthesized.         Data Synthesis:~         After review and discussion, a series of 12 recommendations were generated with suggestions to guide future studies with new treatments for sepsis.         Conclusions:~         We need to improve our ability to define appropriate molecular targets for preclinical development and develop better methods to determine the clinical value of novel sepsis agents. Clinical trials must have realistic sample sizes and meaningful endpoints. Biomarker-driven studies should be considered to categorize specific ``at risk'' populations most likely to benefit from a new treatment. Innovations in clinical trial design such as parallel crossover design, alternative endpoints, or adaptive trials should be pursued to improve the outlook for future interventional trials in sepsis.},

Participants reported significant contributors to strain were: ``inability to discharge ICU patients due to lack of available ward beds'' (97\%); ``increases in the volume'' (89\%); and ``acuity and complexity of patients requiring ICU support'' (88\%). Strain was perceived to ``increase stress levels in health care providers'' (98\%); and ``burnout in health care providers'' (96\%). The highest ranked strategies were: ``have more consistent and better goals-of-care conversations with patients/families outside of ICU'' (95\%); and ``increase non-acute care beds'' (92\%). Strain is perceived as common. HCW believe precipitants represent a mix of patient-related and operational factors. Strain is thought to have negative implications for quality of care, HCW well-being and workplace environment. Most indicated strategies ``outside'' of ICU settings were priorities for managing strain.}

  abstract = {The power of language to modify the reader's perception of interpreting biomedical results cannot be underestimated. Misreporting and misinterpretation are pressing problems in randomized controlled trials (RCT) output. This may be partially related to the statistical significance paradigm used in clinical trials centered around a               P               value below 0.05 cutoff. Strict use of this               P               value may lead to strategies of clinical researchers to describe their clinical results with               P               values approaching but not reaching the threshold to be ``almost significant.'' The question is how phrases expressing nonsignificant results have been reported in RCTs over the past 30 years. To this end, we conducted a quantitative analysis of English full texts containing 567,758 RCTs recorded in PubMed between 1990 and 2020 (81.5\% of all published RCTs in PubMed). We determined the exact presence of 505 predefined phrases denoting results that approach but do not cross the line of formal statistical significance (               P               {$<$} 0.05). We modeled temporal trends in phrase data with Bayesian linear regression. Evidence for temporal change was obtained through Bayes factor (BF) analysis. In a randomly sampled subset, the associated               P               values were manually extracted. We identified 61,741 phrases in 49,134 RCTs indicating almost significant results (8.65\%; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 8.58\% to 8.73\%). The overall prevalence of these phrases remained stable over time, with the most prevalent phrases being ``marginally significant'' (in 7,735 RCTs), ``all but significant'' (7,015), ``a nonsignificant trend'' (3,442), ``failed to reach statistical significance'' (2,578), and ``a strong trend'' (1,700). The strongest evidence for an increased temporal prevalence was found for ``a numerical trend,'' ``a positive trend,'' ``an increasing trend,'' and ``nominally significant.'' In contrast, the phrases ``all but significant,'' ``approaches statistical significance,'' ``did not quite reach statistical significance,'' ``difference was apparent,'' ``failed to reach statistical significance,'' and ``not quite significant'' decreased over time. In a random sampled subset of 29,000 phrases, the manually identified and corresponding 11,926               P               values, 68,1\% ranged between 0.05 and 0.15 (CI: 67. to 69.0; median 0.06). Our results show that RCT reports regularly contain specific phrases describing marginally nonsignificant results to report               P               values close to but above the dominant 0.05 cutoff. The fact that the prevalence of the phrases remained stable over time indicates that this practice of broadly interpreting               P               values close to a predefined threshold remains prevalent. To enhance responsible and transparent interpretation of RCT results, researchers, clinicians, reviewers, and editors may reduce the focus on formal statistical significance thresholds and stimulate reporting of               P               values with corresponding effect sizes and CIs and focus on the clinical relevance of the statistical difference found in RCTs.},

  abstract = {Decades of research have repeatedly shown that people perform poorly at estimating and understanding conditional probabilities that are inherent in Bayesian reasoning problems. Yet in the medical domain, both physicians and patients make daily, life-critical judgments based on conditional probability. Although there have been a number of attempts to develop more effective ways to facilitate Bayesian reasoning, reports of these findings tend to be inconsistent and sometimes even contradictory. For instance, the reported accuracies for individuals being able to correctly estimate conditional probability range from 6\% to 62\%. In this work, we show that problem representation can significantly affect accuracies. By controlling the amount of information presented to the user, we demonstrate how text and visualization designs can increase overall accuracies to as high as 77\%. Additionally, we found that for users with high spatial ability, our designs can further improve their accuracies to as high as 100\%. By and large, our findings provide explanations for the inconsistent reports on accuracy in Bayesian reasoning tasks and show a significant improvement over existing methods. We believe that these findings can have immediate impact on risk communication in health-related fields.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose: The computed tomography angiography or contrast-enhanced computed tomography based spot sign has been proposed as a biomarker for identifying on-going hematoma expansion in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. We investigated, if spot-sign positive participants benefit more from tranexamic acid versus placebo as compared to spot-sign negative participants. Methods: TICH-2 trial (Tranexamic Acid for Hyperacute Primary Intracerebral Haemorrhage) was a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial recruiting acutely hospitalized participants with intracerebral hemorrhage within 8 hours after symptom onset. Local investigators randomized participants to 2 grams of intravenous tranexamic acid or matching placebo (1:1). All participants underwent computed tomography scan on admission and on day 2 (24{$\pm$}12 hours) after randomization. In this sub group analysis, we included all participants from the main trial population with imaging allowing adjudication of spot sign status. Results: Of the 2325 TICH-2 participants, 254 (10.9\%) had imaging allowing for spot-sign adjudication. Of these participants, 64 (25.2\%) were spot-sign positive. Median (interquartile range) time from symptom onset to administration of the intervention was 225.0 (169.0 to 310.0) minutes. The adjusted percent difference in absolute day-2 hematoma volume between participants allocated to tranexamic versus placebo was 3.7\% (95\% CI, -12.8\% to 23.4\%) for spot-sign positive and 1.7\% (95\% CI, -8.4\% to 12.8\%) for spot-sign negative participants (Pheterogenity=0.85). No difference was observed in significant hematoma progression (dichotomous composite outcome) between participants allocated to tranexamic versus placebo among spot-sign positive (odds ratio, 0.85 [95\% CI, 0.29 to 2.46]) and negative (odds ratio, 0.77 [95\% CI, 0.41 to 1.45]) participants (Pheterogenity=0.88). Conclusions: Data from the TICH-2 trial do not support that admission spot sign status modifies the treatment effect of tranexamic acid versus placebo in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. The results might have been affected by low statistical power as well as treatment delay. Registration: URL: http://www.controlled-trials.com; Unique identifier: ISRCTN93732214.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Survivors of critical illness often have a prolonged and disabling form of cognitive impairment that remains inadequately characterized. METHODS We enrolled adults with respiratory failure or shock in the medical or surgical intensive care unit (ICU), evaluated them for in-hospital delirium, and assessed global cognition and executive function 3 and 12 months after discharge with the use of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (population age-adjusted mean [{$\pm$}SD] score, 100{$\pm$}15, with lower values indicating worse global cognition) and the Trail Making Test, Part B (population age-, sex-, and education-adjusted mean score, 50{$\pm$}10, with lower scores indicating worse executive function). Associations of the duration of delirium and the use of sedative or analgesic agents with the outcomes were assessed with the use of linear regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS Of the 821 patients enrolled, 6\% had cognitive impairment at baseline, and delirium developed in 74\% during the hospital stay. At 3 months, 40\% of the patients had global cognition scores that were 1.5 SD below the population means (similar to scores for patients with moderate traumatic brain injury), and 26\% had scores 2 SD below the population means (similar to scores for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease). Deficits occurred in both older and younger patients and persisted, with 34\% and 24\% of all patients with assessments at 12 months that were similar to scores for patients with moderate traumatic brain injury and scores for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, respectively. A longer duration of delirium was independently associated with worse global cognition at 3 and 12 months (P\,=\,0.001 and P\,=\,0.04, respectively) and worse executive function at 3 and 12 months (P\,=\,0.004 and P\,=\,0.007, respectively). Use of sedative or analgesic medications was not consistently associated with cognitive impairment at 3 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS Patients in medical and surgical ICUs are at high risk for long-term cognitive impairment. A longer duration of delirium in the hospital was associated with worse global cognition and executive function scores at 3 and 12 months.

Multiple guidelines suggest using prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) in these patients based upon research that includes a limited number of patients with ICH. Given this, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PCC for FXa inhibitor-related ICH in a large, multicenter cohort of patients. Methods: This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study of patients with apixaban or rivaroxaban-related ICH who received PCC between January 1, 2015 and March 1, 2019. The study had two primary analysis groups: safety and hemostatic efficacy. The safety analysis evaluated all patients meeting inclusion criteria for the occurrence of a thrombotic event, which were censored at hospital discharge or 30 days following PCC administration. Patients with intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural hemorrhages who had at least one follow-up image within 24 hours of PCC administration were assessed for hemostatic efficacy. The primary efficacy outcome was the percentage of patients with excellent or good hemostasis based upon the modified Sarode criteria. Secondary outcomes included an evaluation of in-hospital mortality, length of stay, infusion-related reactions and thrombotic event occurrence during multiple pre-defined periods. Results: A total of 663 patients were included and assessed for safety outcomes. Of these, 433 patients met criteria for hemostatic efficacy evaluation. We observed excellent or good hemostasis in 354 patients (81.8\%; 95\% confidence interval 77.9 \textendash{} 85.2). Twenty-five (3.8\%) patients had a total of 26 thrombotic events, of which 22 occurred in the first 14 days following PCC administration. One patient had documentation of an infusion-related reaction. For the full cohort of patients, in-hospital mortality was 19.0\% and the median intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were 2.0 and 6.0 days, respectively. Conclusions: Administration of PCC after apixaban and rivaroxaban-related ICH provided a high rate of excellent or good hemostasis (81.8\%) coupled with a 3.8\% thrombosis rate. Randomized, controlled trials evaluating the clinical efficacy of PCC in patients with FXa inhibitor-related ICH are needed.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Assessing the long term effects of many surgical interventions tested in pragmatic RCTs may require extended periods of participant follow-up to assess effectiveness and use patient-reported outcomes that require large sample sizes. Consequently the RCTs are often perceived as being expensive and time-consuming, particularly if the results show the test intervention is not effective. Adaptive, and particularly group sequential, designs have great potential to improve the efficiency and cost of testing new and existing surgical interventions. As a means to assess the potential utility of group sequential designs, we re-analyse data from a number of recent high-profile RCTs and assess whether using such a design would have caused the trial to stop early. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Many pragmatic RCTs monitor participants at a number of occasions (e.g. at 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery) during follow-up as a means to assess recovery and also to keep participants engaged with the trial process. Conventionally one of the outcomes is selected as the primary (final) outcome, for clinical reasons, with others designated as either early or late outcomes. In such settings, novel group sequential designs that use data from not only the final outcome but also from early outcomes at interim analyses can be used to inform stopping decisions.},

  abstract = {Sociologists and philosophers have critically examined the interplay between democracy and expertise. This article develops a law and political economy approach to the topic, focusing on the challenge posed to traditional professions by ``meta-experts'' (who develop standardized algorithmic and quantitative methods to trans-substantively evaluate experts' performance and value).The very concept of meta-expertise confounds traditional distinctions between elite and democratic power. On the one hand, the meta-expert seems to suffer from all the debilities of the traditional expert, only more so. Whereas a traditional expert at least has a bounded set of situations to claim to be knowledgeable about, the meta-expert asserts expansive intellectual authority. On the other hand, skeptics of professions (as well as professional skeptics) claim that experts' authority must have some substantive (and not merely democratic and procedural) limits. These skeptics tend to see the meta-expert as a powerful ``tribune of the people,'' capable of vindicating both common sense and counterintuitive findings in the face of guildish lethargy and incuriosity.Law has three critical roles to play in adjudicating emerging conflicts between experts and meta-experts. First, whatever jurisdictional claims they make over some domain may be confirmed or contradicted by lawmakers. Therefore, law is critical to the practical establishment of practical epistemic authority. Second, administrative law has long addressed the balance between legal regularity, politics, and expertise in the proper functioning of agencies.  And most specifically, antitrust law is a particularly potent way of unraveling some modes of professional self-organization and standards, while promoting others. This chapter explores the role of law and political economy in shaping ``battles of the experts,'' as economists and coders challenge the authority of other professionals.},

  abstract = {Background The use of warfarin reduces the rate of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but requires frequent monitoring and dose adjustment. Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may provide more consistent and predictable anticoagulation than warfarin. Methods In a double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 14,264 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk for stroke to receive either rivaroxaban (at a daily dose of 20 mg) or dose-adjusted warfarin. The per-protocol, as-treated primary analysis was designed to determine whether rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin for the primary end point of stroke or systemic embolism. Results In the primary analysis, the primary end point occurred in 188 patients in the rivaroxaban group (1.7\% per year) and in 241 in the warfarin group (2.2\% per year) (hazard ratio in the rivaroxaban group, 0.79; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.96; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary end point occurred in 269 patients in the rivaroxaban group (2.1\% per year) and in 306 patients in the warfarin group (2.4\% per year) (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.74 to 1.03; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority; P\,=\,0.12 for superiority). Major and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 1475 patients in the rivaroxaban group (14.9\% per year) and in 1449 in the warfarin group (14.5\% per year) (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.96 to 1.11; P\,=\,0.44), with significant reductions in intracranial hemorrhage (0.5\% vs. 0.7\%, P\,=\,0.02) and fatal bleeding (0.2\% vs. 0.5\%, P\,=\,0.003) in the rivaroxaban group. Conclusions In patients with atrial fibrillation, rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. There was no significant between-group difference in the risk of major bleeding, although intracranial and fatal bleeding occurred less frequently in the rivaroxaban group.

  abstract = {Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an increasingly diagnosed condition, but the trends in TBI visits and the cost of which have not been quantified from the hospital perspective. Objectives: To quantify the costs of TBI stratified by inpatient and outpatient visits and to examine trends in TBI incidence over time. Methods: This descriptive study utilized data for 2007-2012 from the Premier hospital database, which includes clinical and utilization information from hospitals across the United States. TBI was identified through International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Descriptive data were obtained to identify the TBI costs, visit costs, patient characteristics, and intertemporal trends in TBI rates. Results: TBI patients were treated on an outpatient basis 88\% of the time. Nearly 45\% (44.3\%) of TBI patients requiring inpatient admissions were age 65 or over, and 20\% of TBI patients treated as an outpatient were age 75 or over. Children aged 4 or younger accounted for nearly 14\% of TBI cases treated on an outpatient basis. TBI patients treated in the inpatient setting incurred fairly long hospital visits (mean 4.8 days; median 3.0 days) and substantial hospital costs (mean \$12,717; median \$8,176). The rate of TBI visits have risen substantially over time, especially among children under age 18 years and patients in the Northeast US Census Region. Conclusion: TBI is a serious medical condition that appears to be on the rise. Large differences exist between the hospital costs associated with TBIs treated in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Further research to understand factors affecting the costs and clinical outcomes of TBI can help refine treatment strategies to enhance patient outcomes while providing cost effective care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a serious subset of injuries among persons in the United States, and prehospital care of these injuries can mitigate both the morbidity and the mortality in patients who suffer from these injuries. Guidelines for triage of injured patients have been set forth by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT) in cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines include physiologic criteria, such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, systolic blood pressure, and respiratory rate, which should be used in determining triage of an injured patient. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the numbers of visits at level I and II trauma centers by patients with a diagnosed TBI to determine the prevalence of those meeting physiologic criteria from the ACS-COT/CDC guidelines and to determine the extent of mortality among this patient population. METHODS: The data for this study were taken from the 2007 National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) National Sample Program (NSP). This data set is a nationally representative sample of visits to level I and II trauma centers across the United States and is funded by the American College of Surgeons. Estimates of demographic characteristics, physiologic measures, and death were made for this study population using both chi-square analyses and adjusted logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: The analyses demonstrated that although many people who sustain a TBI and were taken to a level I or II trauma center did not meet the physiologic criteria, those who did meet the physiologic criteria had significantly higher odds of death than those who did not meet the criteria. After controlling for age, gender, race, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and length of stay in the hospital, persons who had a GCS score {$\leq$}13 were 17 times more likely to die than TBI patients who had a higher GCS score (odds ratio [OR] 17.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 10.7-28.3). Other physiologic criteria also demonstrated significant odds of death. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the validity of the ACS-COT/CDC physiologic criteria in this population and stress the importance of prehospital triage of patients with TBI in the hopes of reducing both the morbidity and the mortality resulting from this injury.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The outcomes of large-volume IVF administration to septic shock patients with comorbid congestive heart failure (CHF) and/or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are uncertain and widely debated in the existing literature. Despite this uncertainty, CMS continues to recommend that 30 ml/kg of an intravenous crystalloid solution be administered to patients in septic shock starting within 3 h of presentation. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the relationship between adherence to this guideline and outcomes among patients whose underlying comorbidities present a risk of fluid overload. Methods: Our search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus through November 5, 2021 to identify studies that evaluated clinical outcomes among septic patients with CHF/ESRD based on volume of fluid administered. The primary outcome measured was mortality at 30 days post-hospital discharge. Other outcomes included the rates of vasopressor requirements, invasive mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, as well as length of stay in the intensive care unit and/or hospital. We used random effects meta-analysis when two or more studies reported the same outcome. Results: We included five studies in the final meta-analysis, which comprised 5804 patients, 5260 (91\%) of whom received non-aggressive fluid resuscitation, as defined by the studies' authors. Random-effects meta-analysis for all-cause mortality showed that aggressive fluid resuscitation was associated with statistically non-significant increased odds of mortality (OR 1.42, 95\% CI 0.88\textendash 2.3, P = 0.15, I2 = 35\%). There was no statistical association between volume of IVF administration and other outcomes evaluated. Conclusion: Among septic shock patients with CHF and/or ESRD, administration of greater than or equal to 30 ml/ kg IVF was associated with a non-significant increase in odds of mortality. All other outcomes measured were found to be non-significant, although there was a trend toward better outcomes among patients in the restricted-volume compared to the standard-volume IVF groups. Since this meta-analysis only included five observational studies, more studies are needed to guide an optimal volume and rate of fluid administration in this patient population.},

Survivors of ICH, especially those with atrial fibrillation (AF), are at risk for both recurrent hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular events. A conundrum in the field of vascular neurology, neurosurgery, and cardiology has been the decision to initiate or resume versus withhold anticoagulation in survivors of ICH with AF. To initiate anticoagulation would decrease the risk of ischemic stroke but may increase the risk of hemorrhage. To withhold anticoagulation maintains a lower risk of hemorrhage but does not decrease the risk of ischemic stroke. In this narrative review, we discuss the evidence for and against the use of antithrombotics in ICH survivors with AF, focusing on recently completed and ongoing clinical trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic discontinuation appears to decrease antibiotic use in critically ill patients, but its impact on survival remains less certain. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation in critically ill adults reporting survival or antibiotic duration. Searches were conducted without language restrictions from inception to July 23, 2018. Two reviewers independently conducted all review stages; another adjudicated differences. Data were pooled using random-effects metaanalysis. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and evidence was graded using GRADEpro. RESULTS: Among critically ill adults (5,158 randomized; 5,000 analyzed), PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation was associated with decreased mortality (16 RCTs; risk ratio [RR], 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.83-0.97; I2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0\%; low certainty). Death was the primary outcome in only one study and a survival benefit was not observed in the subset specified as sepsis (10 RCTs; RR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.03; I2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0\%), those without industry sponsorship (nine RCTs; RR, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.87-1.10; I2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0\%), high PCT-guided algorithm adherence (five RCTs; RR, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.711.22; I2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0\%), and PCT-guided algorithms without C-reactive protein (eight RCTs; RR, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.87-1.06; I2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0\%). PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation decreased antibiotic duration (mean difference, 1.31 days; 95\% CI, \textendash 2.27 to \textendash 0.35; I2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 93\%) (low certainty). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of increased survival and decreased antibiotic utilization associated with PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation represent low-certainty evidence with a high risk of bias. This relationship was primarily observed in studies without high protocol adherence and in studies with algorithms combining PCT and C-reactive protein. Properly designed studies with mortality as the primary outcome are needed to address this question.

  abstract = {Background and objectives: Adherence to therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of hyponatremia becomes difficult when water diuresis emerges during therapy. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of desmopressin acetate as a therapeutic agent to avoid overcorrection of hyponatremia and to lower the plasma sodium concentration again after inadvertent overcorrection. Design, setting, participants, \& measurements: Retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients who were given desmopressin acetate during the treatment of hyponatremia during 6 yr in a 528-bed community teaching hospital. Results: Six patients (group 1) were given desmopressin acetate after the 24-h limit of 12 mmol/L had already been reached or exceeded; correction was prevented from exceeding the 48-h limit of 18 mmol/L in five of the six. Fourteen patients (group 2) were given desmopressin acetate in anticipation of overcorrection after the plasma sodium concentration had increased by 1 to 12 mmol/L. In all 14 patients who were treated with desmopressin acetate as a preventive measure, correction was prevented from exceeding either the 24- or 48-h limits. After desmopressin acetate was administered, the plasma sodium concentration of 14 of the 20 patients fell by 2 to 9 mmol/L. In all six group 1 patients and in five of the group 2 patients, the plasma sodium concentration was actively lowered again by the concurrent administration of desmopressin acetate and 5\% dextrose in water; no serious adverse consequences from this maneuver were observed. Conclusion: Desmopressin acetate is effective in preventing and reversing inadvertent overcorrection of hyponatremia. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 3: 331-336, 2008. doi: 10.2215/CJN.03190807},

  abstract = {Background: With progress on both the theoretical and the computational fronts the use of spline modelling has become an established tool in statistical regression analysis. An important issue in spline modelling is the availability of user friendly, well documented software packages. Following the idea of the STRengthening Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies initiative to provide users with guidance documents on the application of statistical methods in observational research, the aim of this article is to provide an overview of the most widely used spline-based techniques and their implementation in R. Methods: In this work, we focus on the R Language for Statistical Computing which has become a hugely popular statistics software. We identified a set of packages that include functions for spline modelling within a regression framework. Using simulated and real data we provide an introduction to spline modelling and an overview of the most popular spline functions. Results: We present a series of simple scenarios of univariate data, where different basis functions are used to identify the correct functional form of an independent variable. Even in simple data, using routines from different packages would lead to different results. Conclusions: This work illustrate challenges that an analyst faces when working with data. Most differences can be attributed to the choice of hyper-parameters rather than the basis used. In fact an experienced user will know how to obtain a reasonable outcome, regardless of the type of spline used. However, many analysts do not have sufficient knowledge to use these powerful tools adequately and will need more guidance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In patients with symptomatic heart failure, sacubitril\textendash valsartan has been found to reduce the risk of hospitalization and death from cardiovascular causes more effectively than an angiotensin-converting\textendash enzyme inhibitor. Trials comparing the effects of these drugs in patients with acute myocardial infarction have been lacking. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with myocardial infarction complicated by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary congestion, or both to receive either sacubitril\textendash valsartan (97 mg of sacubitril and 103 mg of valsartan twice daily) or ramipril (5 mg twice daily) in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was death from cardiovascular causes or incident heart failure (outpatient symptomatic heart failure or heart failure leading to hospitalization), whichever occurred first. RESULTS A total of 5661 patients underwent randomization; 2830 were assigned to receive sacubitril\textendash valsartan and 2831 to receive ramipril. Over a median of 22 months, a primary-outcome event occurred in 338 patients (11.9\%) in the sacubitril\textendash valsartan group and in 373 patients (13.2\%) in the ramipril group (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.04; P\,=\,0.17). Death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure occurred in 308 patients (10.9\%) in the sacubitril\textendash valsartan group and in 335 patients (11.8\%) in the ramipril group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.78 to 1.07); death from cardiovascular causes in 168 (5.9\%) and 191 (6.7\%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 1.08); and death from any cause in 213 (7.5\%) and 242 (8.5\%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.73 to 1.05). Treatment was discontinued because of an adverse event in 357 patients (12.6\%) in the sacubitril\textendash valsartan group and 379 patients (13.4\%) in the ramipril group.

  abstract = {Objectives: To systematically review the literature assessing ARDS mortality over time and to determine patient- and study-level factors independently associated with mortality. Methods: We searched multiple databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL) for prospective observational studies or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published during the period 1984 to 2006 that enrolled 50 or more patients with ALI/ARDS and reported mortality. We pooled mortality estimates using randomeffects meta-analysis and examined mortality trends before and after 1994 (when a consensus definition of ALI/ARDS was published) and factors associated with mortality using meta-regression models. Measurements and Main Results: Of 4,966 studies, 89 met inclusion criteria (53 observational, 36 RCTs). There was a total of 18,900 patients (mean age 51.6 years; 39\% female). Overall pooled weighted mortality was 44.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 41.8\textendash 46.9). Mortality decreased with time in observational studies conducted before 1994; no temporal associations with mortality were demonstrated in RCTs (any time) or observational studies (after 1994). Pooled mortality from 1994 to 2006 was 44.0\% (95\% CI, 40.1\textendash 47.5) for observational studies, and 36.2\% (95\% CI, 32.1\textendash 40.5) for RCTs. Meta-regression identified study type (observational versus RCT, odds ratio, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.08\textendash 1.73) and patient age (odds ratio per additional 10 yr, 1.27; 95\% CI, 1.07\textendash 1.50) as the only factors associated with mortality. Conclusions: A decrease in ARDS mortality was only seen in observational studies from 1984 to 1993. Mortality did not decrease between 1994 (when a consensus definition was published) and 2006, and is lower in RCTs than observational studies.},

To address these issues, we created a consensus of experts endorsed by the Italian Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) to provide clinical guidance. Methods: A multidisciplinary consensus panel composed by 19 physicians selected for their established clinical and scientific expertise in the acute management of SAH patients with different specializations (anesthesia/intensive care, neurosurgery and interventional neuroradiology) was created. A modified Delphi approach was adopted. Results: A total of 14 statements have been discussed. Consensus was reached on 11 strong recommendations and 2 weak recommendations. In one case, where consensus could not be agreed upon, no recommendation could be provided. Conclusions: Management of SAH in a non-specialized setting and early transfer are difficult and may have a critical impact on outcome. Clinical advice, based on multidisciplinary consensus, might be helpful. Our recommendations cover most, but not all, topics of clinical relevance.},

Finally, post-AKI risk of long-term sequelae including incident or progression of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular events and mortality, will be addressed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate the efficacy and safety of rituximab compared with placebo as an add-on to standard of care for MG. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study took place throughout 48 weeks at 7 regional clinics in Sweden. Key inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, onset of generalized symptoms within 12 months or less, and a Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score of 6 or more. Patients were screened from October 20, 2016, to March 2, 2020. Key exclusion criteria included pure ocular MG, suspected thymoma, previous thymectomy, and prior noncorticosteroid immunosuppressants or high doses of corticosteroids. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized 1:1 without stratification to a single intravenous infusion of 500 mg of rituximab or matching placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Minimal disease manifestations at 16 weeks defined as a QMG score of 4 or less with prednisolone, 10 mg or less daily, and no rescue treatment. RESULTS Of 87 potentially eligible patients, 25 were randomized to rituximab (mean [SD] age, 67.4 [13.4] years; 7 [28\%] female) and 22 to placebo (mean [SD] age, 58 [18.6] years; 7 [32\%] female). Compared with placebo, a greater proportion with rituximab met the primary end point; 71\% (17 of 24) in the rituximab group vs 29\% (6 of 21) in the placebo group (Fisher exact test P = .007; probability ratio, 2.48 [95\% CI, 1.20-5.11]). Secondary end points, comparing changes in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living and Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life at 16 weeks with QMG at 24 weeks did not differ between groups with censoring for rescue treatment (per-protocol analysis) but were in favor of active treatment when rescue treatment was taken into account by worst rank imputation (post hoc analysis). Rescue treatments were also more frequent in the placebo arm (rituximab: 1 [4\%]; placebo, 8 [36\%]). One patient in the placebo arm had a myocardial infarction with cardiac arrest and 1 patient in the active arm experienced a fatal cardiac event. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A single dose of 500 mg of rituximab was associated with greater probability of minimal MG manifestations and reduced need of rescue medications compared with placebo. Further studies are needed to address long-term benefit-risk balance with this treatment.},

  abstract = {The primary role of the right ventricle (RV) is to deliver all the blood it receives per beat into the pulmonary circulation without causing right atrial pressure to rise. To the extent that it also does not impede left ventricular (LV) filling, cardiac output responsiveness to increased metabolic demand is optimized. Since cardiac output is a function of metabolic demand of the body, during stress and exercise states the flow to the RV can vary widely. Also, instantaneous venous return varies widely for a constant cardiac output as ventilatory efforts alter the dynamic pressure gradient for venous return. Normally, blood flow varies with minimal changes in pulmonary arterial pressure. Similarly, RV filling normally occurs with minimal increases in right atrial pressure. When pulmonary vascular reserve is compromised RV ejection may also be compromised, increasing right atrial pressure and limiting maximal cardiac output. Acute increases in RV outflow resistance, as may occur with acute pulmonary embolism, will cause acute RV dilation and, by ventricular interdependence, markedly decreased LV diastolic compliance, rapidly spiraling to acute cardiogenic shock and death. Treatments include reversing the causes of pulmonary hypertension and sustaining mean arterial pressure higher than pulmonary artery pressure to maximal RV coronary blood flow. Chronic pulmonary hypertension induces progressive RV hypertrophy to match RV contractility to the increased pulmonary arterial elastance. Once fully developed, RV hypertrophy is associated with a sustained increase in right atrial pressure, impaired LV filling, and decreased exercise tolerance. Treatment focuses on pharmacologic therapies to selectively reduce pulmonary vasomotor tone and diuretics to minimize excessive RV dilation. Owning to the irreversible nature of most forms of pulmonary hypertension, when the pulmonary arterial elastance greatly exceeds the adaptive increase in RV systolic elastance, due to RV dilation, progressive pulmonary vascular obliteration, or both, end stage cor pulmonale ensues. If associated with cardiogenic shock, it can effectively be treated only by artificial ventricular support or lung transplantation. Knowing how the RV adapts to these stresses, its sign posts, and treatment options will greatly improve the bedside clinician's ability to diagnose and treat RV dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Background: Clinical trials are of central importance for the evaluation and comparison of treatments. The transparency and intelligibility of the treatment effect under investigation is an essential matter for physicians, patients, and health-care authorities. The estimand framework has been introduced because many trials are deficient in this respect. Methods: Introduction, definition, and application of the estimand framework on the basis of an example and a selective review of the literature. Results: The estimand framework provides a systematic approach to the definition of the treatment effect under investigation in a clinical trial. An estimand consists of five attributes: treatment, population, variable, population-level summary, and handling of intercurrent events. Each of these attributes is defined in an interdisciplinary discussion during the trial planning phase, based on the clinical question being asked. Special attention is given to the handling of intercurrent events (ICEs): these are events\textemdash e.g., discontinuation or modification of treatment or the use of emergency medication\textemdash that can occur once the treatment has begun and might affect the possibility of observing the endpoints or their interpretability. There are various strategies for the handling of ICEs; these can, for example, also reflect the existing intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Per-protocol analyses, in contrast, are prone to bias and cannot be represented in a sensible manner by an estimand, although they may be performed as a supplementary analysis. The discussion of potential intercurrent events and how they should appropriately be handled in view of the aim of the trial must already take place in the planning phase. Conclusion: Use of the estimand framework should make it easier for both physicians and patients to understand what trials reveal about the efficacy of treatment, and to compare the results of different trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Specific reversal agents for non\textendash vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are lacking. Idarucizumab, an antibody fragment, was developed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. METHODS We undertook this prospective cohort study to determine the safety of 5 g of intravenous idarucizumab and its capacity to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in patients who had serious bleeding (group A) or required an urgent procedure (group B). The primary end point was the maximum percentage reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within 4 hours after the administration of idarucizumab, on the basis of the determination at a central laboratory of the dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time. A key secondary end point was the restoration of hemostasis. RESULTS This interim analysis included 90 patients who received idarucizumab (51 patients in group A and 39 in group B). Among 68 patients with an elevated dilute thrombin time and 81 with an elevated ecarin clotting time at baseline, the median maximum percentage reversal was 100\% (95\% confidence interval, 100 to 100). Idarucizumab normalized the test results in 88 to 98\% of the patients, an effect that was evident within minutes. Concentrations of unbound dabigatran remained below 20 ng per milliliter at 24 hours in 79\% of the patients. Among 35 patients in group A who could be assessed, hemostasis, as determined by local investigators, was restored at a median of 11.4 hours. Among 36 patients in group B who underwent a procedure, normal intraoperative hemostasis was reported in 33, and mildly or moderately abnormal hemostasis was reported in 2 patients and 1 patient, respectively. One thrombotic event occurred within 72 hours after idarucizumab administration in a patient in whom anticoagulants had not been reinitiated.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, short-term antifibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce the risk of rebleeding. However, whether this treatment improves clinical outcome is unclear. We investigated whether ultra-early, short-term treatment with tranexamic acid improves clinical outcome at 6 months. METHODS: In this multicentre prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label trial with masked outcome assessment, adult patients with spontaneous CT-proven subarachnoid haemorrhage in eight treatment centres and 16 referring hospitals in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to treatment with tranexamic acid in addition to care as usual (tranexamic acid group) or care as usual only (control group). Tranexamic acid was started immediately after diagnosis in the presenting hospital (1 g bolus, followed by continuous infusion of 1 g every 8 h, terminated immediately before aneurysm treatment, or 24 h after start of the medication, whichever came first). The primary endpoint was clinical outcome at 6 months, assessed by the modified Rankin Scale, dichotomised into a good (0-3) or poor (4-6) clinical outcome. Both primary and safety analyses were according to intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02684812. FINDINGS: Between July 24, 2013, and July 29, 2019, we enrolled 955 patients; 480 patients were randomly assigned to tranexamic acid and 475 patients to the control group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, good clinical outcome was observed in 287 (60\%) of 475 patients in the tranexamic acid group, and 300 (64\%) of 470 patients in the control group (treatment centre adjusted odds ratio 0{$\cdot$}86, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}66-1{$\cdot$}12). Rebleeding after randomisation and before aneurysm treatment occurred in 49 (10\%) patients in the tranexamic acid and in 66 (14\%) patients in the control group (odds ratio 0{$\cdot$}71, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}48-1{$\cdot$}04). Other serious adverse events were comparable between groups. INTERPRETATION: In patients with CT-proven subarachnoid haemorrhage, presumably caused by a ruptured aneurysm, ultra-early, short-term tranexamic acid treatment did not improve clinical outcome at 6 months, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale.

Recent findings~         Corticosteroids have been prescribed with the objective to attenuate the marked and persistent activation of the immune system. However, some causes of community-acquired pneumonia, namely viral, are associated with unexpected low levels of cytokines and depressed cellular immunity. As a result, several recent randomized controlled trials and large prospective observational studies repeatedly showed that corticosteroids had no impact on survival, and in some types of pneumonia like influenza, its use was associated with potential harmful effects like invasive aspergillosis. Apart from this, adverse effects, namely hyperglycemia, superinfections and increased length-of-stay, were frequent findings in the corticosteroid-treated patients.         Summary~         According to the current evidence, corticosteroids are recommended in Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-infected patients and recommendations are against its use in influenza. In all other forms of severe community-acquired pneumonia, with the exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the strength of the evidence does not support the safe and widespread use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy. Further studies are needed to identify subgroups of severe community-acquired pneumonia that can benefit or not from corticosteroids.},

The time from sequencing the virus to authorizing the first COVID-19 vaccine was so brisk even the optimists appear close-minded. Yet, simultaneously, United States' COVID-19 vaccination roll-out and related policies have contained missed opportunities, blunders, run counter to evidence-based medicine, and revealed limitations in the judgment of public policymakers. Misplaced utilization, contradictory messaging, and poor deployment in those who would benefit most \textemdash{} the elderly and high-risk \textemdash{} alongside unrealistic messaging, exaggeration, and coercion in those who benefit least \textemdash{} young, healthy Americans \textemdash{} is at the heart. It is important to consider the history of COVID-19 vaccines to identify where we succeeded and where we failed, and the effects that these errors may have more broadly on vaccination hesitancy and routine childhood immunization programs in the decades to come.},

Data Sources:~         A PubMed literature review was performed.         Study Selection:~         Articles relevant to prognosis in intracerebral hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and postcardiac arrest anoxic encephalopathy were selected.         Data Extraction:~         Data regarding definition and prognosis of devastating brain injury were extracted. Themes related to how clinicians perform prognostication and their accuracy were reviewed and extracted.         Data Synthesis:~         Although there are differences in pathophysiology and therefore prognosis in the various etiologies of devastating brain injury, some common themes emerge. Physicians tend to have fairly good prognostic accuracy, especially in severe cases with poor prognosis. Full supportive care is recommended for at least 72 hours from initial presentation to maximize the potential for recovery and minimize secondary injury. However, physician approaches to the timing of and recommendations for withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy have a significant impact on mortality from devastating brain injury.         Conclusions:~         Intensivists should consider the modern literature describing prognosis for devastating brain injury and provide appropriate time for patient recovery and for discussions with the patient's surrogates. Surrogates wish to have a prognosis enumerated even when uncertainty exists. These discussions must be handled with care and include admission of uncertainty when it exists. Respect for patient autonomy remains paramount, although physicians are not required to provide inappropriate medical therapies.},

  abstract = {Background\hspace{0.6em}Acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) is associated with significant acute mortality. It is unclear whether later mortality is predominantly driven by preexisting comorbid disease, the acute inciting event or is the result of AHRF itself. Methods\hspace{0.6em} Observational cohort study of elderly US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) participants in fee-for-service Medicare (1998\textendash 2012). Patients hospitalised with AHRF were matched 1:1 to otherwise similar adults who were not currently hospitalised and separately to patients hospitalised with acute inciting events (pneumonia, non-pulmonary infection, aspiration, trauma, pancreatitis) that may result in AHRF, here termed at-risk hospitalisations. The primary outcome was late mortality\textemdash death in the 31 days to 2 years following hospital admission. Results\hspace{0.6em}Among 15\,075\,HRS participants, we identified 1268 AHRF and 13\,117 at-risk hospitalisations. AHRF hospitalisations were matched to 1157 non-hospitalised adults and 1017 at-risk hospitalisations. Among patients who survived at least 30 days, AHRF was associated with a 24.4\% (95\%CI 19.9\% to 28.9\%, p{$<$}0.001) absolute increase in late mortality relative to adults not currently hospitalised and a 6.7\% (95\%CI 1.7\% to 11.7\%, p=0.01) increase relative to adults hospitalised with acute inciting event(s) alone. At-risk hospitalisation explained 71.2\% of the increased odds of late mortality, whereas the development of AHRF itself explained 28.8\%. Risk for death was equivalent to at-risk hospitalisation beyond 90\,days, but remained elevated for more than 1\,year compared with non-hospitalised controls. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em}In this national sample of older Americans, approximately one in four survivors with AHRF had a late death not explained by pre-AHRF health status. More than 70\% of this increased risk was associated with hospitalisation for acute inciting events, while 30\% was associated with hypoxemic respiratory failure.},

  abstract = {Background: Many studies have documented an obesity paradox\textemdash a survival advantage of being obese\textemdash in populations diagnosed with a medical condition. Whether obesity is causally associated with improved mortality in these conditions is unresolved. Methods: We develop the logic of collider bias as it pertains to the association between smoking and obesity in a diseased population. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) are used to investigate this bias empirically among persons with diabetes and prediabetes (dysglycemia). We also use NHANES to investigate whether reverse causal pathways are more prominent among people with dysglycemia than in the source population. Cox regression analysis is used to examine the extent of the obesity paradox among those with dysglycemia. In the regression analysis, we explore interactions between obesity and smoking, and we implement a variety of data restrictions designed to reduce the extent of reverse causality. Results: We find an obesity paradox among persons with dysglycemia. In this population, the inverse association between obesity and smoking is much stronger than in the source population, and the extent of illness and weight loss is greater. The obesity paradox is absent among never-smokers. Among smokers, the paradox is eliminated through successive efforts to reduce the extent of reverse causality. Conclusion: Higher mortality among normal-weight people with dysglycemia is not causal but is rather a product of the closer inverse association between obesity and smoking in this subpopulation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether the recommendation of awake prone positioning is associated with improved outcomes among patients with COVID-19\textendash related hypoxemia who have not received mechanical ventilation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This pragmatic nonrandomized controlled trial was conducted at 2 academic medical centers (Vanderbilt University Medical Center and NorthShore University HealthSystem) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 501 adult patients with COVID-19\textendash associated hypoxemia who had not received mechanical ventilation were enrolled from May 13 to December 11, 2020. INTERVENTIONS Patients were assigned 1:1 to receive either the practitioner-recommended awake prone positioning intervention (intervention group) or usual care (usual care group). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome analyses were performed using a bayesian proportional odds model with covariate adjustment for clinical severity ranking based on the World Health Organization ordinal outcome scale, which was modified to highlight the worst level of hypoxemia on study day 5. RESULTS A total of 501 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.0 [15.3] years; 284 [56.7\%] were male; and most [417 (83.2\%)] were self-reported non-Hispanic or non-Latinx) were included. Baseline severity was comparable between the intervention vs usual care groups, with 170 patients (65.9\%) vs 162 patients (66.7\%) receiving oxygen via standard low-flow nasal cannula, 71 patients (27.5\%) vs 62 patients (25.5\%) receiving oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula, and 16 patients (6.2\%) vs 19 patients (7.8\%) receiving noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Nursing observations estimated that patients in the intervention group spent a median of 4.2 hours (IQR, 1.8-6.7 hours) in the prone position per day compared with 0 hours (IQR, 0-0.7 hours) per day in the usual care group. On study day 5, the bayesian posterior probability of the intervention group having worse outcomes than the usual care group on the modified World Health Organization ordinal outcome scale was 0.998 (posterior median adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.63; 95\% credibility interval [CrI], 1.16-2.31). However, on study days 14 and 28, the posterior probabilities of harm were 0.874 (aOR, 1.29; 95\% CrI, 0.84-1.99) and 0.673 (aOR, 1.12; 95\% CrI, 0.67-1.86), respectively. Exploratory outcomes (progression to mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and 28-day mortality) did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this nonrandomized controlled trial, prone positioning offered no observed clinical benefit among patients with COVID-19\textendash associated hypoxemia who had not received mechanical ventilation. Moreover, there was substantial evidence of worsened clinical outcomes at study day 5 among patients recommended to receive the awake prone positioning intervention, suggesting potential harm.},

METHODS: We defined moderate and severe hyperglycemia based on serum glucose levels {$\geq$}140 mg/dL\textemdash{$<$}180 and {$\geq$}180 mg/dL, respectively, measured at baseline, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Persistent hyperglycemia was defined by 2 consecutive (24 hours apart) serum glucose levels. We evaluated the relationship between moderate and severe hyperglycemia and death or disability (defined by modified Rankin Scale score of 4\textendash 6) at 90 days in the overall cohort and in groups defined by preexisting diabetes. RESULTS: In the multivariate analysis, both moderate (odds ratio, 1.8 [95\% CI, 1.1\textendash 2.8]) and severe (odds ratio, 1.8 [95\% CI, 1.2\textendash 2.7]) hyperglycemia were associated with higher 90-day death or disability after adjusting for Glasgow Coma Scale score, hematoma volume, presence or absence of intraventricular hemorrhage, hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, and hypertension (no interaction between hyperglycemia and preexisting diabetes, P=0.996). Among the patients without preexisting diabetes, both moderate (odds ratio, 1.8 [95\% CI, 1.0\textendash 3.2]) and severe (odds ratio, 2.0 [95\% CI, 1.1\textendash 3.7]) hyperglycemia were associated with 90-day death or disability after adjusting for above mentioned potential confounders. Among the patients with preexisting diabetes, moderate and severe hyperglycemia were not associated with 90-day death or disability. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent hyperglycemia, either moderate or severe, increased the risk of death or disability in nondiabetic patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Limited data are available to guide the choice of a target for the systolic blood-pressure level when treating acute hypertensive response in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. METHODS We randomly assigned eligible participants with intracerebral hemorrhage (volume, {$<$}60 cm3) and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 5 or more (on a scale from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating worse condition) to a systolic blood-pressure target of 110 to 139 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or a target of 140 to 179 mm Hg (standard treatment) in order to test the superiority of intensive reduction of systolic blood pressure to standard reduction; intravenous nicardipine to lower blood pressure was administered within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. The primary outcome was death or disability (modified Rankin scale score of 4 to 6, on a scale ranging from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 3 months after randomization, as ascertained by an investigator who was unaware of the treatment assignments. RESULTS Among 1000 participants with a mean ({$\pm$}SD) systolic blood pressure of 200.6{$\pm$}27.0 mm Hg at baseline, 500 were assigned to intensive treatment and 500 to standard treatment. The mean age of the patients was 61.9 years, and 56.2\% were Asian. Enrollment was stopped because of futility after a prespecified interim analysis. The primary outcome of death or disability was observed in 38.7\% of the participants (186 of 481) in the intensive-treatment group and in 37.7\% (181 of 480) in the standard-treatment group (relative risk, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.27; analysis was adjusted for age, initial GCS score, and presence or absence of intraventricular hemorrhage). Serious adverse events occurring within 72 hours after randomization that were considered by the site investigator to be related to treatment were reported in 1.6\% of the patients in the intensive-treatment group and in 1.2\% of those in the standard-treatment group. The rate of renal adverse events within 7 days after randomization was significantly higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (9.0\% vs. 4.0\%, P\,=\,0.002).

  abstract = {Background: Researchers often misinterpret and misrepresent statistical outputs. This abuse has led to a large literature on modification or replacement of testing thresholds and P-values with confidence intervals, Bayes factors, and other devices. Because the core problems appear cognitive rather than statistical, we review some simple methods to aid researchers in interpreting statistical outputs. These methods emphasize logical and information concepts over probability, and thus may be more robust to common misinterpretations than are traditional descriptions. Methods: We use the Shannon transform of the P-value p, also known as the binary surprisal or S-value s = -log2(p), to provide a measure of the information supplied by the testing procedure, and to help calibrate intuitions against simple physical experiments like coin tossing. We also use tables or graphs of test statistics for alternative hypotheses, and interval estimates for different percentile levels, to thwart fallacies arising from arbitrary dichotomies. Finally, we reinterpret P-values and interval estimates in unconditional terms, which describe compatibility of data with the entire set of analysis assumptions. We illustrate these methods with a reanalysis of data from an existing record-based cohort study. Conclusions: In line with other recent recommendations, we advise that teaching materials and research reports discuss P-values as measures of compatibility rather than significance, compute P-values for alternative hypotheses whenever they are computed for null hypotheses, and interpret interval estimates as showing values of high compatibility with data, rather than regions of confidence. Our recommendations emphasize cognitive devices for displaying the compatibility of the observed data with various hypotheses of interest, rather than focusing on single hypothesis tests or interval estimates. We believe these simple reforms are well worth the minor effort they require.},

  abstract = {Objective: Isotonic saline is the most commonly used crystalloid in the ICU, but recent evidence suggests that balanced fluids like Lactated Ringer's solution may be preferable. We examined the association between choice of crystalloids and in-hospital mortality during the resuscitation of critically ill adults with sepsis. Design: A retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with sepsis, not undergoing any surgical procedures, and treated in an ICU by hospital day 2. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding and compared the following outcomes after resuscitation with balanced versus with no-balanced fluids: in-hospital mortality, acute renal failure with and without dialysis, and hospital and ICU lengths of stay. We also estimated the \-dose-response relationship between receipt of increasing proportions of balanced fluids and in-hospital mortality. Setting: Three hundred sixty U.S. hospitals that were members of the Premier Healthcare alliance between November 2005 and December 2010. Patients: A total of 53,448 patients with sepsis, treated with vasopressors and crystalloids in an ICU by hospital day 2 including 3,396 (6.4\%) that received balanced fluids. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Patients treated with balanced fluids were younger and less likely to have heart or chronic renal failure, but they were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation, invasive monitoring, colloids, steroids, and larger crystalloid volumes (median 7 vs 5\,L). Among 6,730 patients in a p\- ropensity-matched cohort, receipt of balanced fluids was associated with lower inhospital mortality (19.6\% vs 22.8\%; relative risk, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.78, 0.94). Mortality was progressively lower among patients receiving larger proportions of balanced fluids. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of acute renal failure (with and without dialysis) or in-hospital and ICU lengths of stay. Conclusions: Among critically ill adults with sepsis, resuscitation with balanced fluids was associated with a lower risk of in-hospital mortality. If confirmed in randomized trials, this finding could have significant public health implications, as crystalloid resuscitation is nearly universal in sepsis.

In neurocritical patients, nonneurological complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI) are independent predictors of worse clinical outcomes. Different research groups have reported an AKI incidence of 11.6\% and an incidence of stage 3 AKI, accord-ing to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, that requires dialysis of 3\% to 12\% in neurocritical patients. These patients tend to be younger, have less comorbidity, and have a different risk profile, given the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures they undergo. Trauma-induced AKI, sepsis, sympathetic overstimulation, tubular epitheliopa-thy, hyperchloremia, use of nephrotoxic drugs, and renal hypoperfusion are some of the causes of AKI in neurocritical patients. AKI is the result of a sum of events, although the mechanisms underlying many of them remain uncertain; however, two important causes that merit mention are direct alteration of the physiological brain\textendash kidney connection and exposure to injury as a result of the specific medical management and well-established therapies that neurocriti-cal patients are subjected to. This review will focus on AKI in neurocritical care patients. Specifically, it will discuss its epidemiology, causes, associated mechanisms, and relationship to the brain\textendash kidney axis. Additionally, the use and risks of extracorporeal therapies in this group of patients will be reviewed.},

Causal and prediction research usually require different methods, and yet their findings may get conflated when reported and interpreted. The aim of the current study is to quantify the frequency of conflation between etiological and prediction research, to discuss common underlying mistakes and provide recommendations on how to avoid these. Observational cohort studies published in January 2018 in the top-ranked journals of six distinct medical fields (Cardiology, Clinical Epidemiology, Clinical Neurology, General and Internal Medicine, Nephrology and Surgery) were included for the current scoping review. Data on conflation was extracted through signaling questions. In total, 180 studies were included. Overall, 26\% (n\,=\,46) contained conflation between etiology and prediction. The frequency of conflation varied across medical field and journal impact factor. From the causal studies 22\% was conflated, mainly due to the selection of covariates based on their ability to predict without taking the causal structure into account. Within prediction studies 38\% was conflated, the most frequent reason was a causal interpretation of covariates included in a prediction model. Conflation of etiology and prediction is a common methodological error in observational medical research and more frequent in prediction studies. As this may lead to biased estimations and erroneous conclusions, researchers must be careful when designing, interpreting and disseminating their research to ensure this conflation is avoided.},

  abstract = {Mortality is still the most assessed outcome in the critically ill patient and is routinely used as the primary end-point in intervention trials, cohort studies, and benchmarking analysis. Despite this, interest in patient-centered prognosis after ICU discharge is increasing, and several studies report quality of life and long-term outcomes after critical illness. In a recent issue of Critical Care, Cuthbertson and colleagues reported interesting results from a cohort of 439 patients with sepsis, who showed high ongoing long-term mortality rates after severe sepsis, reaching 61\% at 5 years (from a starting point of ICU admission). Follow-up may start at ICU admission, after ICU discharge, or after hospital discharge. Using ICU admission as a starting point will include patients with a wide range of illness severities and reasons for ICU admission. As a result, important consequences of the ICU, such as rehabilitation and reduced quality of life, may be diluted in an unselected population. ICU discharge is another frequently used starting point. ICU discharge is a marker of better outcome and reduced risk for acute deterioration, making this an interesting starting point for studying long-term mortality, need for ICU readmission, and critical illness rehabilitation. Finally, using hospital discharge as the starting point will include patients with the minimal requirements to sustain an adequate condition in a non-monitored environment but will add a ?survivors bias?; that is, patients who survive critical illness are a special group among the critically ill. In this commentary, we discuss the heterogeneity in long-term mortality from recent studies in critical care medicine ? heterogeneity that may be a consequence simply of changing the follow-up starting point ? and propose a standardized follow-up starting point for future studies according to the outcome of interest.},

  abstract = {There is high usage of antibiotics in the emergency department (ED) for children with acute respiratory illnesses. Studies have reported decreased antibiotic use among inpatients with rapid respiratory pathogen (RRP) testing.To determine whether RRP testing leads to decreased antibiotic use and health care use among children with influenzalike illness (ILI) in an ED.A randomized clinical trial among children aged 1 month to 18 years presenting to an ED with ILI from December 1, 2018, to November 30, 2019, was conducted. Data were analyzed March 23, 2020, to April 2, 2021. All children received a nasopharyngeal swab for RRP testing and were randomized 1:1 to the intervention group or control group (results not given, routine clinical care). Results were available in 45 minutes. Intention-to-treat analyses and modified intention-to-treat (clinician knows results) analyses were conducted using multivariable Poisson regression.Rapid respiratory pathogen test results given to clinicians.Antibiotic prescribing was the primary outcome; influenza antiviral prescribing, ED length of stay, hospital admission, and recurrent health care visits were the secondary outcomes.Among 931 ED visits (intervention group, 452 children group and control group, 456 children after exclusion of those not meeting criteria or protocol violations), a total of 795 RRP test results (85\%) were positive. The median age of the children was 2.1 years (interquartile range, 0.9-5.6 years); 509 (56\%) were boys. Most children (478 [53\%]) were Hispanic, 688 children (76\%) received government insurance, and 314 (35\%) had a high-risk medical condition. In the intention-to-treat intervention group, children were more likely to receive antibiotics (relative risk [RR], 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.0-1.7), with no significant differences in antiviral prescribing, medical visits, and hospitalization. In inverse propensity-weighted modified intention-to-treat analyses, children with test results known were more likely to receive antivirals (RR, 2.6; 95\% CI, 1.6-4.5) and be hospitalized (RR, 1.8; 95\% CI, 1.4-2.5); there was no significant difference in antibiotic prescribing (RR, 1.1; 95\% CI, 0.9-1.4).The use of RRP testing in the ED for ILI did not decrease antibiotic prescribing in this randomized clinical trial. There is a limited role for RRP pathogen testing in children in this setting.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03756753},

  abstract = {Background: A meta-analysis concerning perioperative coagulation competence, hemorrhage, and outcome was conducted including the use of hydroxyethyl starches (HESs), dextran, or albumin versus administration of a crystalloid as control to assess the efficacy and safety of colloids and crystalloids for fluid administration during major elective surgery. Surgery was restricted to cardiovascular and noncardiovascular surgery, and HESs were stratified to HES 130/0.4 and HES 200/0.5. Methods: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, conference proceedings, reference lists, and databases of ongoing trials. Results: Thirty one primary clinical randomized controlled trials included 2287 patients undergoing major surgery from January 2000 to August 2015. The perioperative changes in coagulation competence were measured by thromboelastography (TEG) maximum amplitude (MA) in 9 studies administering crystalloids versus HES and in 4 studies administering albumin versus HES. All studies but 1 disclosed increased reduction in TEG-MA following HES administration (P = 0.0001 and 0.0002). The total loss of blood was reported in 17 studies in which crystalloids were compared to HES and 12 studies reported increased blood loss after administration of HES (P {$<$} 0.003). When administering albumin versus HES, 6 studies reported reduced hemorrhage associated with albumin administration (P = 0.005). Reoperation was not significantly reduced by the use of crystalloids, but may be more frequent after HESs compared to albumin (P {$<$} 0.03). In this analysis, more patients admitted to administration of HESs were exposed to decrease coagulation competence, compared to perioperative crystalloids and albumin administration. Conclusion: This stratified meta-analysis showed that increased blood loss was found in noncardiovascular surgery among patients receiving HES compared with crystalloids, followed by a marked reduction in TEG-MA, and infusion of 3rd-generation HES products did not influence the results significantly.},

  abstract = {Objectives:~         Optimal fluid management is important in patients with acute brain injury, including subarachnoid hemorrhage. We aimed to examine the relationship between daily fluid intake and fluid balance with hospital complications and functional outcome.         Design:~         Retrospective observational cohort study.         Setting:~         Neurocritical care unit at a tertiary academic medical center.         Patients:~         Two-hundred thirty-seven consecutive nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage patients admitted to the neurologic ICU between 2010 and 2016.         Interventions:~         Total daily amount of fluids and fluid balance were calculated over 15 days. Using multivariate generalized estimating equation models the association of daily fluid intake and fluid balance with disease severity, hospital complications and poor functional outcome (3-mo modified Rankin Score {$\geq$} 3) was investigated. Additionally, we described the composition of fluids given.         Measurements and Main Results:~         Patients presented with a median admission Hunt and Hess grade of 3 (interquartile range, 1\textendash 5) and were 57 years old (interquartile range, 47\textendash 67 yr old). A higher daily fluid intake was associated with higher admission Hunt and Hess grade (odds ratio, 1.61; 95\% CI, 1.47\textendash 1.76; p {$<$} 0.001), increased pulmonary fluid accumulation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.01\textendash 1.21; p = 0.033), prolonged mechanical ventilation (Wald statistic = 20.08; degrees of freedom = 1; p {$<$} 0.001), higher daily Subarachnoid hemorrhage Early Brain Edema Score (adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.01\textendash 1.22; p = 0.034), occurrence of anemia (adjusted odds ratio, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.20\textendash 1.54; p {$<$} 0.001), delayed cerebral ischemia (adjusted odds ratio, 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.14\textendash 1.51; p {$<$} 0.001), and poor functional outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25; 95\% CI, 1.10\textendash 1.41; p {$<$} 0.001). Daily fluid balance was associated with higher admission Hunt and Hess grade (odds ratio, 1.09; 95\% CI, 1.05\textendash 1.13; p {$<$} 0.001) and anemia (adjusted odds ratio, 1.17; 95\% CI, 1.03\textendash 1.33; p = 0.019). The main contributors to fluids were nutritional compounds (31\%), IV drugs (30\%), and volume substitution (17\%).         Conclusions:~         Our study demonstrates a significant association of fluid intake but not fluid balance with hospital complications and poor functional outcome in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. A larger prospective study is needed to confirm our results.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies consistently show that prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) increases with ageing. Nonetheless, complaints of ED even in younger men are becoming more and more frequent. Healthcare professionals working in Sexual Medicine but even those operating in different clinical contexts might be adequately prepared to answer this increasing requirement. ED in younger men is likely to be overlooked and dismissed without performing any medical assessment, even the most basic ones, such as collection of medical history and physical exam. This is due to the widespread assumption that ED in younger individuals is a self-limiting condition, which does not deserve any clinical evaluation or therapy and can be managed only with patient reassurance. However, evidence shows that, in younger subjects, organic, psychological and relational conditions can contribute to the pathogenesis of ED and all these conditions might be evaluated and treated, whenever necessary. Among the organic conditions contributing to the onset of ED, metabolic and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors are surprisingly of particular relevance in this age group. In fact, in younger men with ED, even more than in older ones, recognizing CV risk factors or conditions suggestive of cardio-metabolic derangements can help identifying men who, although at low absolute risk due to young age, carry a high relative risk for development of CV events. In this view, the assessment of a possible organic component of ED even in younger individuals acquires a pivotal importance, because it offers the unique opportunity to unearth the presence of CV risk factors, thus allowing effective and high quality preventive interventions.},

  abstract = {BackgroundDiagnostic reasoning requires clinicians to think through complex uncertainties. We tested the possibility of a bias toward an available single diagnosis in uncertain cases.DesignWe developed 5 different surveys providing a succinct description of a hypothetical individual patient scenaric. Each scenario was formulated in 2 versions randomized to participants, with the versions differing only in whether an alternative diagnosis was present or absent. The 5 scenarios were designed as separate tests of robustness using diverse cases, including a cautious scenario, a risky scenario, a sophisticated scenario, a validation scenario, and a comparative scenario (each survey containing only 1 version of 1 scenario). Participants included community members (n = 1104) and health care professionals (n = 200) who judged the chances of COVID infection in an individual patient.ResultsThe first scenario described a cautious patient and found a 47\% reduction in the estimated odds of COVID when a flu diagnosis was present compared with absent (odds ratio = 0.53, 95\% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.94, P = 0.003). The second scenario described a less cautious patient and found a 70\% reduction in the estimated odds of COVID in the presence of a flu diagnosis (odds ratio = 0.30, 95\% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.70, P {$<$} 0.001). The third was a more sophisticated scenario presented to medical professionals and found a 73\% reduction in the estimated odds of COVID in the presence of a mononucleosis diagnosis (odds ratio = 0.27, 95\% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.75, P {$<$} 0.001). Two further scenarios?avoiding mention of population norms?replicated the results.LimitationsBrief hypothetical scenarios may overestimate the extent of bias in more complicated medical situations.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that an available simple diagnosis can lead individuals toward premature closure and a failure to fully consider additional severe diseases.HighlightsOccum?s razor has been debated for centuries yet rarely subjected to experimental testing for evidence-based medicine.This article offers direct evidence that people favor an available simple diagnosis, thereby neglecting to consider additional serious diseases.The bias can lead individuals to mistakenly lower their judged likelihood of COVID or another disease when an alternate diagnosis is present.This misconception over the laws of probability appears in judgments by community members and by health care workers.The pitfall in reasoning extends to high-risk cases and is not easily attributed to information, incentives, or random chance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The efficacy of ivermectin in preventing hospitalization or extended observation in an emergency setting among outpatients with acutely symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is unclear. METHODS We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, adaptive platform trial involving symptomatic SARS-CoV-2\textendash positive adults recruited from 12 public health clinics in Brazil. Patients who had had symptoms of Covid-19 for up to 7 days and had at least one risk factor for disease progression were randomly assigned to receive ivermectin (400 {$\mu$}g per kilogram of body weight) once daily for 3 days or placebo. (The trial also involved other interventions that are not reported here.) The primary composite outcome was hospitalization due to Covid-19 within 28 days after randomization or an emergency department visit due to clinical worsening of Covid-19 (defined as the participant remaining under observation for {$>$}6 hours) within 28 days after randomization.

This article was published on March 30, 2022, and updated on April 5, 2022, at NEJM.org. RESULTS A total of 3515 patients were randomly assigned to receive ivermectin (679 patients), placebo (679), or another intervention (2157). Overall, 100 patients (14.7\%) in the ivermectin group had a primary-outcome event, as compared with 111 (16.3\%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.90; 95\% Bayesian credible interval, 0.70 to 1.16). Of the 211 primary-outcome events, 171 (81.0\%) were hospital admissions. Findings were similar to the primary analysis in a modified intention-to-treat analysis that included only patients who received at least one dose of ivermectin or placebo (relative risk, 0.89; 95\% Bayesian credible interval, 0.69 to 1.15) and in a per-protocol analysis that included only patients who reported 100\% adherence to the assigned regimen (relative risk, 0.94; 95\% Bayesian credible interval, 0.67 to 1.35). There were no significant effects of ivermectin use on secondary outcomes or adverse events. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2115869 Copyright \textcopyright{} 2022 Massachusetts Medical Society. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with ivermectin did not result in a lower incidence of medical admission to a hospital due to progression of Covid-19 or of prolonged emergency department observation among outpatients with an early diagnosis of Covid-19.

  abstract = {Introduction: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines, released in 2017, are a combination of expert opinion and evidence-based medicine, adopted by many institutions as a standard of practice. The aim was to analyse the quality of evidence supporting recommendations on the management of sepsis. Methods: The strength and quality of evidence (high, moderate, low-very low and best practice statements) of each recommendation were extracted. Randomised controlled trials were required to qualify as high-quality evidence. Results: A total of 96 recommendations were formulated, and 87 were included. Among thirty-one (43\%) strong recommendations, only 15.2\% were supported by high-quality evidence. Overall, thirty-seven (42.5\%) recommendations were based on low-quality evidence, followed by 28 (32.2\%) based on moderate-quality, 15 (17.2\%) were best practice statements and only seven (8.0\%) were supported by high-quality evidence. Randomised controlled trials supported 21.4\%, 9.5\% and 8.6\% recommendations on mechanical ventilation, resuscitation, and management/adjuvant therapy, respectively. In contrast, none high-quality evidence recommendation supported antimicrobial/source control (82.4\% were lowvery low evidence or best practice statements), and nutrition. Conclusions: In the SSC guidelines most recommendations were informed by indirect evidence and nonsystematic observations. While awaiting trials results, Delphi-like approaches or multi-criteria decision analyses should guide recommendations.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed from December 2018 through May 2021 in 7 stroke centers in Catalonia, Spain. The study included 121 patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy within 24 hours after stroke onset and with an expanded Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia angiographic score of 2b50 to 3. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to receive intra-arterial alteplase (0.225 mg/kg; maximum dose, 22.5 mg) infused over 15 to 30 minutes (n = 61) or placebo (n = 52). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the difference in proportion of patients achieving a score of 0 or 1 on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) in all patients treated as randomized. Safety outcomes included rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and death. RESULTS The study was terminated early for inability to maintain placebo availability and enrollment rate because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of 1825 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy at the 7 study sites, 748 (41\%) patients fulfilled the angiographic criteria, 121 (7\%) patients were randomized (mean age, 70.6 [SD, 13.7] years; 57 women [47\%]), and 113 (6\%) were treated as randomized. The proportion of participants with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1 at 90 days was 59.0\% (36/61) with alteplase and 40.4\% (21/52) with placebo (adjusted risk difference, 18.4\%; 95\% CI, 0.3\%-36.4\%; P = .047). The proportion of patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 hours was 0\% with alteplase and 3.8\% with placebo (risk difference, -3.8\%; 95\% CI, -13.2\% to 2.5\%). Ninety-day mortality was 8\% with alteplase and 15\% with placebo (risk difference, -7.2\%; 95\% CI, -19.2\% to 4.8\%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke and successful reperfusion following thrombectomy, the use of adjunct intra-arterial alteplase compared with placebo resulted in a greater likelihood of excellent neurological outcome at 90 days. However, because of study limitations, these findings should be interpreted as preliminary and require replication.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To explore the effect of DTAS on clinical outcomes among patients with LVO stroke in a randomized clinical trial. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The study was an investigator-initiated, single-center, evaluator-blinded randomized clinical trial. Of 466 consecutive patients with acute stroke screened, 174 with suspected LVO acute stroke within 6 hours of symptom onset were included. Enrollment took place from September 2018 to November 2020 and was stopped after a preplanned interim analysis. Final follow-up was in February 2021. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to follow either DTAS (89 patients) or conventional workflow (85 patients received direct transfer to computed tomographic imaging, with usual imaging performed and EVT indication decided) to assess the indication of EVT. Patients were stratified according to their having been transferred from a primary center vs having a direct admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a shift analysis assessing the distribution of the 90-day 7-category (from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score among patients with LVO whether or not they received EVT (modified intention-to-treat population) assessed by blinded external evaluators. Secondary outcomes included rate of EVT and door-to-arterial puncture time. Safety outcomes included 90-day mortality and rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS In total, 174 patients were included, with a mean (SD) age of 73.4 (12.6) years (range, 19-95 years), and 78 patients (44.8\%) were women. Their mean (SD) onset-to-door time was 228.0 (117.9) minutes, and their median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 18 (interquartile range [IQR], 14-21). In the modified intention-to-treat population, EVT was performed for all 74 patients in the DTAS group and for 64 patients (87.7\%) in the conventional workflow group (P = .002). The DTAS protocol decreased the median door\textendash to\textendash arterial puncture time (18 minutes [IQR, 15-24 minutes] vs 42 minutes [IQR, 35-51 minutes]; P {$<$} .001) and door-to-reperfusion time (57 minutes [IQR, 43-77 minutes] vs 84 minutes [IQR, 63-117 minutes]; P {$<$} .001). The DTAS protocol decreased the severity of disability across the range of the mRS (adjusted common odds ratio, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.2-4.1; P = .009). Safety variables were comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For patients with LVO admitted within 6 hours after symptom onset, this randomized clinical trial found that, compared with conventional workflow, the use of DTAS increased the odds of patients undergoing EVT, decreased hospital workflow time, and improved clinical outcome.},

  abstract = {Strained intensive care unit (ICU) capacity represents a fundamental supply-demand mismatch in ICU resources. Strain is likely to be influenced by a range of factors; however, there has been no systematic evaluation of the spectrum of measures that may indicate strain on ICU capacity. We performed a systematic review to identify indicators of strained capacity. A comprehensive peer-reviewed search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science Core Collection was performed along with selected grey literature sources. We included studies published in English after 1990. We included studies that: (1) focused on ICU settings; (2) included description of a quality or performance measure; and (3) described strained capacity. Retrieved studies were screened, selected and extracted in duplicate. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). Analysis was descriptive. Of 5297 studies identified in our search; 51 fulfilled eligibility. Most were cohort studies (n = 39; 76.5\%), five (9.8\%) were case-control, three (5.8\%) were cross-sectional, two (3.9\%) were modeling studies, one (2\%) was a correlational study, and one (2\%) was a quality improvement project. Most observational studies were high quality. Sixteen measures designed to indicate strain were identified 110 times, and classified as structure (n = 4, 25\%), process (n = 7, 44\%) and outcome (n = 5, 31\%) indicators, respectively. The most commonly identified indicators of strain were ICU acuity (n = 21; 19.1\% [process]), ICU readmission (n = 18; 16.4\% [outcome]), after-hours discharge (n = 15; 13.6\% [process]) and ICU census (n = 13; 11.8\% [structure]). There was substantial heterogeneity in the operational definitions used to define strain indicators across studies. We identified and characterized 16 indicators of strained ICU capacity across the spectrum of healthcare quality domains. Future work should aim to evaluate their implementation into practice and assess their value for evaluating strategies to mitigate strain. This systematic review was registered at PROSPERO (March 27, 2015; CRD42015017931).}

  abstract = {Objective To determine the impact of delirium on withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WLST) after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the context of established predictors of poor outcome, using data from an institutional ICH registry. Methods We performed a single-center cohort study on consecutive patients with ICH admitted over 12 months. ICH features were prospectively adjudicated, and WLST and corresponding hospital day were recorded retrospectively. Patients were categorized using DSM-5 criteria as never delirious, ever delirious (either on admission or later during hospitalization), or persistently comatose. We determined the impact of delirium on WLST using Cox regression models adjusted for demographics and ICH predictors (including Glasgow Coma Scale score), then used logistic regression with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to compare the accuracy of ICH score\textendash based models with and without delirium category in predicting WLST. Results Of 311 patients (mean age 70.6 {$\pm$} 15.6, median ICH score 1 [interquartile range 1\textendash 2]), 50\% had delirium. WLST occurred in 26\%, and median time to WLST was 1 day (0\textendash 6). WLST was more frequent in patients who developed delirium (adjusted hazard ratio 8.9 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.1\textendash 37.6]), with high rates of WLST in both early (occurring {$\leq$}24 hours from admission) and later delirium groups. An ICH score-based model was strongly predictive of WLST (area under the curve [AUC] 0.902 [95\% CI 0.863\textendash 0.941]), and the addition of delirium category further improved the model's accuracy (AUC 0.936 [95\% CI 0.909\textendash 0.962], p = 0.004). Conclusion Delirium is associated with WLST after ICH regardless of when it occurs. Further study on the impact of delirium on clinician and surrogate decision-making is warranted.},

Most importantly, the probabilities that a parameter is in certain regions of the parameter space are crucial quantities in Bayesian statistics that are not calculable (or considered important) in the frequentist approach that is the basis of much of traditional statistics. In this article, I discuss the implications of these differences for presentation of the results of Bayesian analyses. In doing so, I present more detailed guidelines than are usually provided and explain the rationale for my suggestions.},

There have been many advances in the field of PE in the last few years, requiring a careful assessment of their impact on patient care. However, variations in recommendations by different clinical guidelines, as well as lack of robust clinical trials, make clinical decisions challenging. The Pulmonary Embolism Response Team Consortium is an international association created to advance the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of patients with PE. In this consensus practice document, we provide a comprehensive review of the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of acute PE, including both clinical data and consensus opinion to provide guidance for clinicians caring for these patients.},

The primary aim of this study was to describe the values of partial pressure of oxygen values (PaO                 2                 ) and the episodes of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia occurring within the first 72~h of mechanical ventilation in out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. The secondary aim was to evaluate the association of PaO                 2                 with patients' outcome.                                                        Methods                                Preplanned secondary analysis of the targeted hypothermia versus targeted normothermia after OHCA (TTM2) trial. Arterial blood gases values were collected from randomization every 4~h for the first 32~h, and then, every 8~h until day 3. Hypoxemia was defined as PaO                 2                 \,{$<$}\,60~mmHg and severe hyperoxemia as PaO                 2                 \,{$>$}\,300~mmHg. Mortality and poor neurological outcome (defined according to modified Rankin scale) were collected at 6~months.                                                        Results                                1418 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 64\,{$\pm$}\,14~years, and 292 patients (20.6\%) were female. 24.9\% of patients had at least one episode of hypoxemia, and 7.6\% of patients had at least one episode of severe hyperoxemia. Both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia were independently associated with 6-month mortality, but not with poor neurological outcome. The best cutoff point associated with 6-month mortality for hypoxemia was 69~mmHg (Risk Ratio, RR\,=\,1.009, 95\% CI 0.93\textendash 1.09), and for hyperoxemia was 195~mmHg (RR\,=\,1.006, 95\% CI 0.95\textendash 1.06). The time exposure, i.e., the area under the curve (PaO                 2                 -AUC), for hyperoxemia was significantly associated with mortality (                 p                 \,=\,0.003).                                                        Conclusions               In OHCA patients, both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia are associated with 6-months mortality, with an effect mediated by the timing exposure to high values of oxygen. Precise titration of oxygen levels should be considered in this group of patients.

With origins in the field of probabilistic graphical modelling, DAGs are yet to be widely adopted in applied health research, where causal assumptions are frequently made for the purpose of evaluating health services initiatives. In this context, there is still limited practical guidance on how to construct and use DAGs. Some progress has recently been made in terms of building DAGs based on studies from the literature, but an area that has received less attention is how to create DAGs from information provided by domain experts, an approach of particular importance when there is limited published information about the intervention under study. This approach offers the opportunity for findings to be more robust and relevant to patients, carers and the public, and more likely to inform policy and clinical practice. This article draws lessons from a stakeholder workshop involving patients, health care professionals, researchers, commissioners and representatives from industry, whose objective was to draw DAGs for a complex intervention\textemdash online consultation, i.e. written exchange between the patient and health care professional using an online system\textemdash in the context of the English National Health Service. We provide some initial, practical guidance to those interested in engaging with domain experts to develop DAGs.},

However, conventional clinical trials that randomise individual subjects are costly and unwieldy. Such trials are also often criticised as having low external validity.

Methods: A postal survey among a representative sample of Norwegian physicians across all specialities (N = 1605), using a translated questionnaire previously used to study attitudes towards disclosing prognostic information among US internists. Results: A response rate of 70\% was obtained after one reminder. 85\% of the responders agreed to the helpfulness of an optimistic attitude. A factor analysis revealed three meaningful factors: `Prognostic communication is stressful', `Fearing loss of reputation' and `Reinforcement of positive prospects'. In multivariable models significantly more female than male physicians found aspects of prognostication straining (b = 0.143, p {$<$} 0.001). Those more experienced in communication of prognostic information towards end of life were less likely to support using reinforcement of positive prospects (b = 0.067, p = 0.001). Conclusion: After years of focusing on patient autonomy and open communication between patient and physician many Norwegian physicians display attitudes that might hide the true content of prognostic information from the patients.},

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables\textemdash colliders and mediators\textemdash should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

  abstract = {Introduction: In clinical trials, ordinal outcome measures are often dichotomized into two categories. In traumatic brain injury (TBI) the 5-point Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) is collapsed into unfavourable versus favourable outcome. Simulation studies have shown that exploiting the ordinal nature of the GOS increases chances of detecting treatment effects. The objective of this study is to quantify the benefits of ordinal analysis in the real-life situation of a large TBI trial. Methods: We used data from the CRASH trial that investigated the efficacy of corticosteroids in TBI patients (n = 9,554). We applied two techniques for ordinal analysis: proportional odds analysis and the sliding dichotomy approach, where the GOS is dichotomized at different cut-offs according to baseline prognostic risk. These approaches were compared to dichotomous analysis. The information density in each analysis was indicated by a Wald statistic. All analyses were adjusted for baseline characteristics. Results: Dichotomous analysis of the six-month GOS showed a non-significant treatment effect (OR = 1.09, 95\% CI 0.98 to 1.21, P = 0.096). Ordinal analysis with proportional odds regression or sliding dichotomy showed highly statistically significant treatment effects (OR 1.15, 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.25, P = 0.0007 and 1.19, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.30, P = 0.0002), with 2.05-fold and 2.56-fold higher information density compared to the dichotomous approach respectively. Conclusions: Analysis of the CRASH trial data confirmed that ordinal analysis of outcome substantially increases statistical power. We expect these results to hold for other fields of critical care medicine that use ordinal outcome measures and recommend that future trials adopt ordinal analyses. This will permit detection of smaller treatment effects.},

  abstract = {Fluid therapy is an important component of care for patients with traumatic brain injury, but whether it modulates clinical outcomes remains unclear.To determine whether continuous infusion of hypertonic saline solution improves neurological outcome at 6 months in patients with traumatic brain injury.Multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted in 9 intensive care units in France, including 370 patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who were recruited from October 2017 to August 2019. Follow-up was completed in February 2020.Adult patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury were randomly assigned to receive continuous infusion of 20\% hypertonic saline solution plus standard care (n\,=\,185) or standard care alone (controls; n\,=\,185). The 20\% hypertonic saline solution was administered for 48 hours or longer if patients remained at risk of intracranial hypertension.The primary outcome was Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) score (range, 1-8, with lower scores indicating worse functional outcome) at 6 months, obtained centrally by blinded assessors and analyzed with ordinal logistic regression adjusted for prespecified prognostic factors (with a common odds ratio [OR] \&gt;1.0 favoring intervention). There were 12 secondary outcomes measured at multiple time points, including development of intracranial hypertension and 6-month mortality.Among 370 patients who were randomized (median age, 44 [interquartile range, 27-59] years; 77 [20.2\%] women), 359 (97\%) completed the trial. The adjusted common OR for the GOS-E score at 6 months was 1.02 (95\% CI, 0.71-1.47; P\,=\,.92). Of the 12 secondary outcomes, 10 were not significantly different. Intracranial hypertension developed in 62 (33.7\%) patients in the intervention group and 66 (36.3\%) patients in the control group (absolute difference, -2.6\% [95\% CI, -12.3\% to 7.2\%]; OR, 0.80 [95\% CI, 0.51-1.26]). There was no significant difference in 6-month mortality (29 [15.9\%] in the intervention group vs 37 [20.8\%] in the control group; absolute difference, -4.9\% [95\% CI, -12.8\% to 3.1\%]; hazard ratio, 0.79 [95\% CI, 0.48-1.28]).Among patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, treatment with continuous infusion of 20\% hypertonic saline compared with standard care did not result in a significantly better neurological status at 6 months. However, confidence intervals for the findings were wide, and the study may have had limited power to detect a clinically important difference.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03143751},

  abstract = {Objective. To delineate ACP's potential benefits and missed opportunities and identify an evidence-informed, clinically relevant path ahead for ACP in serious illness. Methods. We conducted a narrative review merging the best available ACP empirical data, grey literature, and emergent scholarly discourse using a snowball search of PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar (2000-2022). Findings were informed by our team's interprofessional clinical and research expertise in serious illness care. Results. Early ACP practices were largely tied to mandated document completion, potentially failing to capture the holistic preferences of patients and surrogates. ACP models focused on serious illness communication rather than documentation show promising patient and clinician results. Ideally, ACP would lead to goal-concordant care even amid the unpredictability of serious illness trajectories. But ACP might also provide a false sense of security that patients' wishes will be honored and revisited at end-of-life. An iterative, `building block' framework to integrate ACP throughout serious illness is provided alongside clinical practice, research, and policy recommendations. Conclusions. We advocate a balanced approach to ACP, recognizing empirical deficits while acknowledging potential benefits and ethical imperatives (e.g., fostering clinician-patient trust and shared decision-making). We support prioritizing patient/surrogate-centered outcomes with more robust measures to account for interpersonal clinician-patient variables that likely inform ACP efficacy and may better evaluate information gleaned during serious illness encounters.

Here we evaluated whether tocilizumab plus remdesivir provides greater benefit than remdesivir alone in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial included patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring\,{$>$}\,6 L/min supplemental oxygen. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously plus\,{$\leq$}\,10 days of remdesivir. The primary outcome was time from randomization to hospital discharge or ``ready for discharge'' (defined as category 1, assessed by the investigator on a 7-category ordinal scale of clinical status) to day 28. Patients were followed for 60 days. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Among 649 enrolled patients, 434 were randomly assigned to tocilizumab plus remdesivir and 215 to pla-cebo plus remdesivir. 566 patients (88.2\%) received corticosteroids during the trial to day 28. Median time from rand-omization to hospital discharge or ``ready for discharge'' was 14 (95\% CI 12\textendash 15) days with tocilizumab plus remdesivir and 14 (95\% CI 11\textendash 16) days with placebo plus remdesivir [log-rank P\,=\,0.74; Cox proportional hazards ratio 0.97 (95\% CI 0.78\textendash 1.19)]. Serious adverse events occurred in 128 (29.8\%) tocilizumab plus remdesivir and 72 (33.8\%) placebo plus remdesivir patients; 78 (18.2\%) and 42 (19.7\%) patients, respectively, died by day 28.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose\textemdash Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most fatal and disabling stroke subtype. Widely used tools for prediction of mortality are fundamentally limited in that they do not account for effects of withdrawal of care and are not designed to predict functional recovery. We developed an acute clinical score to predict likelihood of functional independence. Methods\textemdash We prospectively characterized 629 consecutive patients with ICH at hospital presentation. Predictors of functional independence (Glasgow Outcome Score Ն4) at 90 days were used to develop a logistic regression-based risk stratification scale in a random subset of two thirds and validated in the remaining one third of the cohort. Results\textemdash At 90 days, 162 (26\%) patients achieved independence. Age, Glasgow Coma Scale, ICH location, volume (all PϽ0.0001), and pre-ICH cognitive impairment (Pϭ0.005) were independently associated with Glasgow Outcome Score Ն4. The FUNC score was developed as a sum of individual points (0 \textendash 11) based on strength of association with outcome. In both the development and validation cohorts, the proportion of patients who achieved Glasgow Outcome Score Ն4 increased steadily with FUNC score. No patient assigned a FUNC score Յ4 achieved functional independence, whereas Ͼ80\% with a score of 11 did. The predictive accuracy of the FUNC score remained unchanged when restricted to ICH survivors only, consistent with absence of confounding by early withdrawal of care. Conclusions\textemdash FUNC score is a valid clinical assessment tool that identifies patients with ICH who will attain functional independence and thus, can provide guidance in clinical decision-making and patient selection for clinical trials.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Autoimmune diseases affecting the nervous systems are a common cause of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Although there exist several well-described clinical syndromes, patients more commonly present with progressive neurologic dysfunction and laboratory and radiographic evidence of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. In the critical care setting, the urgency to intervene to prevent permanent damage to the nervous system and secondary injury from the systemic manifestations of these syndromes often conflicts with diagnostic uncertainty. Furthermore, treatment is limited by current therapeutic agents that remain non-specific for individual diseases, especially for those whose pathophysiology remains unclear. Primary autoimmune, paraneoplastic, parainfectious, and iatrogenic neurologic disorders all share the common underlying pathophysiology of an adaptive immune response directed against an antigen within the nervous system. Several different mechanisms of immune dysfunction are responsible for pathogenesis within each of these categories of disease, and it is at this level of pathophysiology that the most effective and appropriate therapeutic decisions are made. In this review, we outline the basic diagnostic and therapeutic principles in the management of autoimmune diseases of the nervous system in the ICU. We approach these disorders not as lists of distinct clinical syndromes or molecular targets of autoimmunity but rather as clusters of syndromes based on these common underlying mechanisms of immune dysfunction. This approach emphasizes early intervention over precise diagnosis. As our understanding of the immune system continues to grow, this framework will allow for a more sophisticated approach to the management of patients with these complex, often devastating but frequently reversible, neurologic illnesses.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We have evaluated the antihypertensive effect of bedtime administration of aspirin in patients with cardiovascular disease already treated for hypertension. Methods: This is a multicenter randomized triple-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial, with hypertensive patients treated with aspirin for secondary prevention. There was a baseline-randomized assignment to 2-month periods of bedtime aspirin (100 mg) first and morning-time aspirin later, or inversely, both periods separated by an open label 2\textendash 4 weeks period of morning-time aspirin. At the start and end of each treatment period, a 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed. The main outcome measure was mean 24-h blood pressure. The analyses were performed according to the intentionto-treat principle. Results: Overall, 225 patients were randomized. No significant differences were observed in ambulatory blood pressure by time of intake of usual low doses of aspirin. The mean SBP/DBP was 123.2/69.9 (95\% CI 121.58\textendash 124.9/68.86\textendash 76.86) with bedtime administration and 122.4/68.8 (95\% CI 120.76\textendash 124.01/67.85\textendash 69.83) with daytime administration (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.3 and P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.23 for SBP and DBP, respectively). Conclusion: Administering aspirin at bedtime rather than in the morning does not modify the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive patients in secondary cardiovascular prevention. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01741922).},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Vasopressors are administered to critically ill patients with vasodilatory shock not responsive to volume resuscitation, and less often in cardiogenic shock, and hypovolemic shock. Objectives:\hspace{0.6em} The objectives are to review safety and efficacy of vasopressors, pathophysiology, agents that decrease vasopressor dose, predictive biomarkers, {$\beta$}1-blockers, and directions for research. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} The quality of evidence was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Results:\hspace{0.6em} Vasopressors bind adrenergic: {$\alpha$}1, {$\alpha$}2, {$\beta$}1, {$\beta$}2; vasopressin: AVPR1a, AVPR1B, AVPR2; angiotensin II: AG1, AG2; and dopamine: DA1, DA2 receptors inducing vasoconstriction. Vasopressor choice and dose vary because of patients and physician practice. Adverse effects include excessive vasoconstriction, organ ischemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlactatemia, tachycardia, and tachyarrhythmias. No randomized controlled trials of vasopressors showed a significant difference in 28-day mortality rate. Norepinephrine is the first-choice vasopressor in vasodilatory shock after adequate volume resuscitation. Some strategies that decrease norepinephrine dose (vasopressin, angiotensin II) have not decreased 28-day mortality while corticosteroids have decreased 28-day mortality significantly in some (two large trials) but not all trials. In norepinephrine-refractory patients, vasopressin or epinephrine may be added. A new vasopressor, angiotensin II, may be useful in profoundly hypotensive patients. Dobutamine may be added because vasopressors may decrease ventricular contractility. Dopamine is recommended only in bradycardic patients. There are potent vasopressors with limited evidence (e.g. methylene blue, metaraminol) and novel vasopressors in development (selepressin). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Norepinephrine is first choice followed by vasopressin or epinephrine. Angiotensin II and dopamine have limited indications. In future, predictive biomarkers may guide vasopressor selection and novel vasopressors may emerge.},

DESIGN:~         Prospective, observational, mixed-methods cohort study.         SETTING:~         Comprehensive stroke and level 1 trauma center in Pacific Northwest United States.         PARTICIPANTS:~         Family members of patients with severe acute brain injury in an ICU for greater than 2 days and Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 12.         MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:~         At enrollment, we asked what level of physical and cognitive recovery the patient would find acceptable. At 6 months, we assessed level of recovery through family surveys and chart review. Families of patients whose outcome was below that considered acceptable were invited for semistructured interviews, examined with content analysis.         RESULTS:~         For 184 patients, most family members set patients' minimally acceptable cognitive recovery at ``able to think and communicate'' or better (82\%) and physical recovery at independence or better (66\%). Among 170 patients with known 6-month outcome, 40\% had died in hospital. Of 102 survivors, 33\% were able to think and communicate, 13\% were independent, and 10\% died after discharge. Among survivors whose family member had set minimally acceptable cognitive function at ``able to think and communicate,'' 64\% survived below that level; for those with minimally acceptable physical function at independence, 80\% survived below that. Qualitative analysis revealed two key themes: families struggled to adapt to a new, yet uncertain, normal and asked for support and guidance with ongoing treatment decisions.         CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:~         Six months after severe acute brain injury, most patients survived to a state their families initially thought would not be acceptable. Survivors and their families need more support and guidance as they adapt to a new normal and struggle with persistent uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Objective\hspace{0.6em} The traditional approach of null hypothesis testing dominates the design and analysis of randomised controlled trials. This study aimed to demonstrate how a simple Bayesian analysis could have been used to analyse the Optimisation of Perioperative Cardiovascular Management to Improve Surgical Outcome (OPTIMISE) trial to obtain more clinically interpretable results. Design, setting, participants and interventions\hspace{0.6em}The OPTIMISE trial was a pragmatic, multicentre, observerblinded, randomised controlled trial of 734 high-risk patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery in 17 acute care hospitals in the UK. Patients were randomly allocated to a cardiac output-guided haemodynamic therapy algorithm for intravenous fluid and inotropic drug administration during and in the 6\,hours following surgery (n=368) or to standard care (n=366). The primary outcome was a binary outcome consisting of a composite of predefined 30-day moderate or major complications and mortality. Methods\hspace{0.6em} We repeated the primary outcome analysis of the OPTIMISE trial using Bayesian statistical methods to calculate the probability that the intervention was superior, and the probability that a clinically relevant difference existed. We explored the impact of a flat prior and an evidence-based prior on our analyses. Results\hspace{0.6em} Although OPTIMISE was not powered to detect a statistically significant difference between the treatment arms for the observed effect size (relative risk=0.84, 95\%\,CI 0.70 to 1.01; p=0.07), by using Bayesian analyses we were able to demonstrate that there was a 96.9\% (flat prior) to 99.5\% (evidence-based prior) probability that the intervention was superior to the control. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} The use of a Bayesian analytical approach provided a different interpretation of the findings of the OPTIMISE trial (compared with the original frequentist analysis), and suggested patient benefit from the intervention. Incorporation of information from previous studies provided further evidence of a benefit from the intervention. Bayesian analyses can produce results that are more easily interpretable and relevant to clinicians and policy-makers. Trial registration number\hspace{0.6em} ISRCTN04386758; Postresults.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and prognosis of intracerebral hemorrhage. METHODS: We analyzed data referring to our prospective population-based registry, including patients with a first-ever stroke followed up to 10 years. RESULTS: In a 5-year period, we included 549 patients (247 men and 302 women; mean age+/-SD, 73.6+/-12.5 years) with an intracerebral hemorrhage. The crude annual incidence rate was 36.9 per 100000 (95\% CI, 33.8 to 40.0), 32.9 per 100000 when standardized to the 2006 European population, and 15.9 per 100000 when standardized to the world population. The case-fatality rate was 34.6\% (95\% CI, 30.6 to 38.6) at 7 days; it increased to 50.3\% (95\% CI, 46.1 to 54.5) at 30 days and to 59.0\% (95\% CI, 54.9 to 63.1) at 1 year. Diabetes mellitus and posterior fossa hemorrhage were associated with an increased risk of 7- and 30-day mortality, whereas older age was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality only. At the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 10-year survival rate was 24.1\% (95\% CI, 20.1 to 28.1). CONCLUSIONS: Intracerebral hemorrhage is characterized by a severe prognosis, mostly in the short term. Because of the high proportion of fatal events that occurs early after the stroke, it is mandatory to identify and apply specific therapeutic strategies for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.},

DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study using segmented and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the associations of catecholamine dose, lactate concentration, and timing from shock onset at vasopressin initiation with in-hospital mortality. SETTING: Multiple hospitals within the Cleveland Clinic Health System. PATIENTS: Adult patients who met criteria for septic shock based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Adult Sepsis Event definition. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received continuous infusion vasopressin as an adjunct to catecholamine vasopressors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In total, 1,610 patients were included with a mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III 109.0 {$\pm$} 35.1 and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 14.0 {$\pm$} 3.5; 41\% of patients survived the hospital admission. At the time of vasopressin initiation, patients had median (interquartile range) lactate concentration 3.9 mmol/L (2.3\textendash 7.2 mmol/L), norepinephrine-equivalent dose 25 \textmu g/min (18\textendash 40 \textmu g/min), and 5.3 hours (2.1\textendash 12.2\,hr) elapsed since shock onset. The odds of in-hospital mortality increased 20.7\% for every 10 \textmu g/min increase in norepinephrine-equivalent dose up to 60 \textmu g/min at the time of vasopressin initiation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.21 [95\% CI, 1.09\textendash 1.34]), but no association was detected when the norepinephrine-equivalent dose exceeded 60 \textmu g/min (adjusted odds ratio, 0.96 [95\% CI, 0.84\textendash 1.10]). There was a significant interaction between timing of vasopressin initiation and lactate concentration (p = 0.02) for the association with in-hospital mortality. A linear association between increasing in-hospital mortality was detected for increasing lactate concentration at the time of vasopressin initiation, but no association was detected for time elapsed from shock onset. CONCLUSIONS: Higher norepinephrine-equivalent dose at vasopressin initiation and higher lactate concentration at vasopressin initiation were each associated higher in-hospital mortality in patients with septic shock who received vasopressin.},

However, after vasopressin was rebranded in November 2014, its cost exponentially increased. Utilization patterns of vasopressin after its rebranding are unclear. The objective of this study was to determine if there is an association between the rebranding of vasopressin in November 2014 and its utilization in vasopressor-dependent patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter, database study between January 2010 and March 2017. SETTING: Premier Healthcare Database hospitals. PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted to an ICU with severe sepsis or septic shock, who received at least one vasoactive agent for two or more calendar days were included. INTERVENTIONS: The proportion of patients who received vasopressin and vasopressin cost was assessed before and after rebranding, and evaluated with segmented regression. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 294,733 patients (mean age, 66 {$\pm$} 15 yr), 27.8\% received vasopressin, and ICU mortality was 26.5\%. The proportion of patients receiving vasopressin was higher after rebranding (31.2\% postrebranding vs 25.8\% prerebranding). Before vasopressin rebranding, the quarterly proportion of patients who received vasopressin had an increasing slope (prerebranding slope 0.41\% [95\% CI, 0.35\textendash 0.46\%]), with no difference in slope detected after vasopressin rebranding (postrebranding slope, 0.47\% [95\% CI, 0.29\textendash 0.64\%]). After vasopressin rebranding, mean vasopressin cost per patient was higher (\$527 {$\pm$} 1,130 vs \$77 {$\pm$} 160), and the quarterly slope of vasopressin cost was higher (change in slope \$77.18 [95\% CI, \$75.73\textendash 78.61]). Total vasopressin billed cost postrebranding continually increased by \textasciitilde\$294,276 per quarter from less than \$500,000 in Q4 2014 to over \$3,000,000 in Q1 2017. CONCLUSIONS: After vasopressin rebranding, utilization continued to increase quarterly despite a significant increase in vasopressin cost.

All-cause mortality (16 studies [3,842 patients]; RR, 0.85 [95\%~CI, 0.67-1.07]; P~= .17; I2~= 14\%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.61-1.09), ICU admission (six studies [2,619 patients]; RR, 0.66 [95\%~CI, 0.45-0.97]; P~= .04; I2~= 0\%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.37-1.12), treatment failure (six studies [2,093 patients]; RR, 0.78 [95\%~CI, 0.37-1.67]; P~= .52; I2~= 68\%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.02-25.5), and the incidence of adverse events (six studies [2,487 patients]; RR, 1.10 [95\%~CI, 0.97-1.25]; P~= .14; I2~= 53\%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.82-2.41) were similar between patients receiving corticosteroids and patients assigned to the control group. The need for mechanical ventilation (eight studies [1,457 patients]; RR, 0.51 [95\%~CI, 0.33-0.77]; P~= .001; I2~= 0\%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.20-0.85) was lower among patients receiving corticosteroids compared with those receiving standard care. However, corticosteroid use may be associated with higher rates of hospital readmission (five studies [2,853 patients]; RR, 1.20 [95\%~CI, 1.05-1.38]; P~= .008; I2~= 0\%; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.89-1.98). Interpretation Corticosteroid therapy is associated with a lower incidence of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation among patients hospitalized with CAP. No association was found between corticosteroid therapy and mortality, treatment failure, or adverse events. Trial Registry PROSPERO; No.: CRD42021279359; URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/},

  abstract = {Background: Posterior circulation and anterior circulation strokes share many clinical, pathogenetic and radiological features, although some clinical signs are highly specific to posterior circulation strokes. Arterial stenosis and occlusions occur in significant numbers in both acute posterior circulation and anterior circulation strokes, making them good candidates for endovascular treatment. Among posterior circulation strokes, basilar artery occlusions stand out because of the diagnostic and acute treatment challenges. Methods: We reviewed the literature on clinical stroke syndromes and neuroimaging findings and systematically describe for each anatomical site of stroke the detailed clinical and radiological information (anatomical representation, diffusion weighted imaging and angiographic sequences). The principles of neuroimaging of posterior circulation strokes and the prognosis for each stroke localization are also discussed. Review summary: Stroke syndromes in the territories of the vertebral, basilar, cerebellar, and posterior cerebral arteries are presented. Features typical of posterior circulation strokes are highlighted, including patterns of basilar artery occlusions. Clinical severity and prognosis of posterior circulation strokes are highly variable, and given that they are more difficult to detect on CT-based neuroimaging, magnetic resonance imaging is the technique of choice in suspected posterior circulation strokes. Rapid identification of arterial occlusion patterns may provide prognostic information and support acute revascularization decisions. Conclusions: Posterior circulation stroke syndromes tightly reflect lesion localization and arterial occlusion patterns. Although many clinical and pathogenetic features are similar to anterior circulation strokes, notable differences exist in terms of clinical presentation, stroke mechanism, prognosis, and response to acute recanalization.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hematoma volume and impaired level of consciousness are the most potent predictors of outcome after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The effect of preceding aspirin-use on outcome after ICH is poorly investigated. We investigated short-term mortality and hematoma enlargement in subjects with ICH to find the predictors for these outcomes. METHODS: This population-based study included all subjects with ICH during a period of 33 months in the population of Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland. The subjects were identified, and their clinical characteristics and outcomes were checked from hospital records or death records. RESULTS: Three-month mortality of the 208 identified subjects with ICH was 33\%. The independent risk factors for death were regular aspirin-use at the onset of ICH (relative risks [RR], 2.5; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 4.6; P=0.004), warfarin-use at the onset of ICH (RR, 3.2; 95\% CI, 1.6 to 6.1; P=0.001), and ICH score higher than 2 on admission (RR, 13.8; 95\% CI, 6.0 to 31.4; P{$<$}0.001). Regular aspirin-use preceding the onset of ICH associated significantly with hematoma enlargement during the first week after ICH (P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: We observed poor short-term outcomes and increased mortality, probably attributable to rapid enlargement of hematomas, in the subjects with ICH who had been taking regularly moderate doses of aspirin (median 250 mg) immediately before the onset of the stroke.},

  abstract = {Introduction Dysregulated systemic inflammation is the primary driver of mortality in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Current guidelines favor a 7\textendash 10-day course of any glucocorticoid equivalent to dexamethasone 6 mg{$\cdot$}day-1. A comparative RCT with a higher dose and a longer duration of intervention was lacking. Methods We conducted a multi-center, open-label RCT to investigate methylprednisolone 80 mg as a continuous daily infusion for 8 days followed by slow tapering versus dexamethasone 6 mg daily for up to 10 days in adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen or noninvasive respiratory support. Primary outcome: reduction in 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: mechanical ventilation-free days at 28 days, need for ICU referral, length of hospitalisation, need for tracheostomy, changes in PaO2:FiO2 ratio, C-reactive protein levels and WHO clinical progression scale at days 3, 7, and 14. Results 677 randomised patients were included. Findings are reported as methylprednisolone (n=337) versus dexamethasone (n=340). By day 28, there were no significant differences in mortality (35[10.4\%] versus 41[12.1\%]; p=0.49), nor in the median mechanical ventilation-free days (23[14] versus 24[16]; p=0.49). ICU referral was necessary in 41[12.2\%] versus 45[13.2\%]; p=0.68 and tracheostomy in 8[2.4\%] versus 9[2.6\%]; p=0.82. Survivors in the methylprednisolone group required a longer median hospitalisation (15[11] versus 14[11] days; p=0.005) and experienced an improvement in C-reactive protein levels, but not in PaO2:FiO2 ratio, at days 7 and 14. There were no differences in disease progression at the prespecified timepoints. Conclusion Prolonged, higher dose methylprednisolone did not reduce mortality at 28 days compared to conventional dexamethasone in COVID-19 pneumonia.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Optimal blood pressure (BP) management in the acute phase of ischemic stroke remains an unresolved issue. It is uncertain whether guidelines for BP management during and after intravenous alteplase can be extrapolated to endovascular treatment (EVT) for stroke due to large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation. We evaluated the associations between systolic BP (SBP) in the first 6 hours following EVT and functional outcome as well as symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. METHODS: Patients of 8 MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) Registry centers, with available data on SBP in the 6 hours following EVT, were analyzed. We evaluated maximum, minimum, and mean SBP. Study outcomes were functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale) at 90 days and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. We used multivariable ordinal and binary regression analysis to adjust for important prognostic factors and studied possible effect modification by successful reperfusion. RESULTS: Post-EVT SBP data were available for 1161/1796 patients. Higher maximum SBP (per 10 mm\,Hg increments) was associated with worse functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.93 [95\% CI, 0.88\textendash 0.98]) and a higher rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.17 [95\% CI, 1.02\textendash 1.36]). The association between minimum SBP and functional outcome was nonlinear with an inflection point at 124 mm\,Hg. Minimum SBP lower and higher than the inflection point were associated with worse functional outcomes (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.85 per 10 mm\,Hg decrements [95\% CI, 0.76\textendash 0.95] and adjusted common odds ratio, 0.81 per 10 mm\,Hg increments [95\% CI, 0.71\textendash 0.92]). No association between mean SBP and functional outcome was observed. Successful reperfusion did not modify the relation of SBP with any of the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Maximum SBP in the first 6 hours following EVT is positively associated with worse functional outcome and an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Both lower and higher minimum SBP are associated with worse outcomes. A randomized trial to evaluate whether modifying post-intervention SBP results in better outcomes after EVT for ischemic stroke seems justified.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the factors associated with incident lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and death in patients with CAA presenting with TFNEs. DATA SOURCES A systematic review and individual participant meta-analysis including (1) a hospital-based cohort and (2) the results obtained from a systematic search performed in MEDLINE and Embase completed in December 2019. STUDY SELECTION Included studies were observational reports of TFNEs. Patient-level clinical, imaging, and prognostic data were required for inclusion. For aggregate data studies, patient-level data were requested. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines by 4 independent reviewers. The quality of reports was determined based on the modified Pearson Case Report Quality Scale. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The clinical characteristics of TFNEs, neuroimaging features, and use of antithrombotics during follow-up were considered exposures. The predefined main outcomes were lobar ICH and risk of death during follow-up. RESULTS Forty-two studies and 222 CAA-associated TFNE cases were included from the initial 1612 records produced by the systematic search; 26 additional patients (11 men [42.3\%]; mean [SD] age, 77 [8] years) were provided by the hospital-based cohort. A total of 108 TFNEs (43.5\%) consisted of motor symptoms. Convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage and cortical superficial siderosis were detected in 193 individuals (77.8\%) and 156 individuals (62.9\%) in the systematic search and hospital-based cohort, respectively. Follow-up duration could be obtained in 185 patients (median duration, 1 year [IQR, 0.8-2.5 years]). During follow-up, symptomatic lobar ICH occurred in 76 patients (39.4\%). Motor symptoms (odds ratio, 2.08 [95\% CI, 1.16-3.70]) at baseline and antithrombotic use during follow-up (odds ratio, 3.61 [95\% CI, 1.67-7.84]) were associated with an increase in risk of lobar ICH. A total of 31 patients (16.5\%) died during follow-up; lobar ICH during follow-up and cortical superficial siderosis were the main risk factors for death (odds ratio, 3.01 [95\% CI, 1.36-6.69]; odds ratio, 3.20 [95\% CI, 1.16-8.91], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients presenting with CAA-associated TFNEs are at high risk of lobar ICH and death. Motor TFNEs and use of antithrombotics after a TFNE, in many cases because of misdiagnosis, are risk factors for ICH, and therefore accurate diagnosis and distinguishing this condition from transient ischemic attacks is critical.},

  abstract = {The aim of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based guidance for temperature control in adults who are coma-tose after resuscitation from either in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, regardless of the underlying cardiac rhythm. These guidelines replace the recommendations on temperature management after cardiac arrest included in the 2021 post-resuscitation care guidelines co-issued by the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the Euro-pean Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM). The guideline panel included thirteen international clinical experts who authored the 2021 ERC-ESICM guidelines and two methodologists who participated in the evidence review completed on behalf of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) of whom ERC is a member society. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of evidence and grade recommendations. The panel provided suggestions on guideline implementation and identified priorities for future research. The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to low. In patients who remain comatose after cardiac arrest, we recommend continuous monitoring of core temperature and actively preventing fever (defined as a temperature\,{$>$}\,37.7 \textdegree C) for at least 72 h. There was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against temperature control at 32\textendash 36 \textdegree C or early cooling after cardiac arrest. We recommend not actively rewarming comatose patients with mild hypothermia after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) to achieve normothermia. We recommend not using prehospital cooling with rapid infusion of large volumes of cold intravenous fluids immediately after ROSC.},

Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) contributes to secondary brain injury by causing brain ischemia, hypoxia, and metabolic dysfunction. Because ICP is easily measured at the bedside, it is the target of numerous pharmacologic and surgical interventions in efforts to improve brain physiology and limit secondary injury. However, ICP may not adequately reflect the metabolic health of the underlying brain tissue, particularly in cases of focal brain injury. As a result, ICP control alone may be insufficient to impact patients' long-term recovery. Further studies are needed to better understand the combination of cerebral, hemodynamic, and metabolic markers that are best utilized to ensure optimal brain and systemic recovery and overall patient outcome after brain injury.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine which multicenter randomized controlled trials in critically ill patients have shown that the study intervention was associated with a statistically significant reduction in mortality. Our analysis provides an update to a report published 10 years ago. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE database and PubMed interface from inception until April 30, 2019. STUDY SELECTION: All adult multicenter randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of any intervention or monitoring system in critically ill patients and reported mortality as a primary or secondary outcome were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Numbers of centers and patients, type of intervention, reported mortality outcome, and rate and level of significance were extracted into predefined tables. Included randomized controlled trials were classified as reporting reduced, increased, or no effect of the intervention on mortality. Methodologic quality of trials was evaluated using the updated Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 212 trials met the inclusion criteria: 27 (13\%) reported a significant reduction in mortality, 16 (7\%) an increase in mortality, and 170 (80\%) no difference in mortality (one study was reported in 2 groups). Of the 27 trials reporting reduced mortality, six had assessed interventions likely to decrease ventilator-induced lung injury, including low tidal volume, prone position, and neuromuscular blockers, demonstrating the negative effects of mechanical ventilation strategies or improved process of care rather than positive effects of new therapies. Seven of the 27 trials reported beneficial effects of noninvasive ventilation. Results from some positive randomized controlled trials, for example, studies of recombinant activated protein C, talactoferrin, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in sepsis, and muscle relaxants in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome were not replicated in subsequent randomized controlled trials. Other interventions, for example, gastric tonometry, have been abandoned. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic literature search provided no conclusive evidence of any pharmacologic intervention that has consistently reduced mortality in critically ill patients. Strategies associated with improved or noninvasive mechanical ventilation were associated with reduced mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The prognoses with respect to mortality and hepatic and nonhepatic outcomes across the histologic spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are not well defined. METHODS We prospectively followed a multicenter patient population that included the full histologic spectrum of NAFLD. The incidences of death and other outcomes were compared across baseline histologic characteristics. RESULTS A total of 1773 adults with NAFLD were followed for a median of 4 years. All-cause mortality increased with increasing fibrosis stages (0.32 deaths per 100 personyears for stage F0 to F2 [no, mild, or moderate fibrosis], 0.89 deaths per 100 persons-years for stage F3 [bridging fibrosis], and 1.76 deaths per 100 personyears for stage F4 [cirrhosis]). The incidence of liver-related complications per 100 person-years increased with fibrosis stage (F0 to F2 vs. F3 vs. F4) as follows: variceal hemorrhage (0.00 vs. 0.06 vs. 0.70), ascites (0.04 vs. 0.52 vs. 1.20), encephalopathy (0.02 vs. 0.75 vs. 2.39), and hepatocellular cancer (0.04 vs. 0.34 vs. 0.14). As compared with patients with stage F0 to F2 fibrosis, patients with stage F4 fibrosis also had a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes (7.53 vs. 4.45 events per 100 person-years) and a decrease of more than 40\% in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (2.98 vs. 0.97 events per 100 person-years). The incidence of cardiac events and nonhepatic cancers were similar across fibrosis stages. After adjustment for age, sex, race, diabetes status, and baseline histologic severity, the incidence of any hepatic decompensation event (variceal hemorrhage, ascites, or encephalopathy) was associated with increased all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.8; 95\% confidence interval, 2.2 to 21.3).

  abstract = {Best practice guidelines have advanced severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) care, however, little currently informs goals of care decisions and processes despite their importance and frequency.   Panelists from the Seattle International severe traumatic Brain Injury Consensus Conference (SIBICC) participated in a survey consisting of 24 questions. Questions queried use of prognostic calculators, variability in and responsibility for goals of care decisions, acceptability of neurological outcomes as well as putative means of improving decisions which may limit care. 97.6\% of the 42 SIBICC panelists completed the survey. Responses were highly variable to most questions. Overall panelists reported infrequent use of prognostic calculators and observing variability in patient prognostication and goals of care decisions. They felt that it would be beneficial for physicians to improve consensus on what constitutes an acceptable neurological outcome as well as what chance of achieving that outcome is acceptable. Panelists felt that the public should help to define what constitutes a good outcome and expressed some support for a `nihilism guard'. Over 50\% of panelists felt that if it was certain to be enduring, a vegetative state or lower severe disability would justify a withdrawal of care decision while 15\% felt that upper severe disability justified such a decision. Whether conceptualizing an ideal or existing prognostic calculator to predict death or an unacceptable outcome, a 64-69\% chance of a poor outcome on average was felt to justify treatment withdrawal. These results demonstrate important variability in goals of care decision making and a desire to reduce this variability. Our panel of recognized TBI experts opined on the neurological outcomes and chances of those outcomes which might prompt consideration of care withdrawal, however imprecision of prognostication and existing prognostication tools is a significant impediment to standardizing the approach to care limiting decisions.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter cohort study was conducted in 34 ICUs in France from 2007 to 2019 and recruited all patients who received a clinical diagnosis of encephalitis and exhibited cerebrospinal fluid positivity for herpes simplex virus DNA in the polymerase chain reaction analysis. Data analysis was performed from January to April 2020. EXPOSURES All patients underwent a standard brain MRI during the first 30 days after ICU admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES MRI acquisitions were analyzed by radiologists blinded to patients' outcomes, using a predefined score. Multivariable logistic regression and supervised hierarchical classifiers methods were used to identify factors associated with poor outcome at 90 days, defined by a score of 3 to 6 (indicating moderate-to-severe disability or death) on the Modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS Overall, 138 patients (median [interquartile range \{IQR\}] age, 62.6 [54.0-72.0] years; 75 men [54.3\%]) with an admission median (IQR) Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9 (6-12) were studied. The median (IQR) delay between ICU admission and MRI was 1 (1-7) days. At 90 days, 95 patients (68.8\%) had a poor outcome, including 16 deaths (11.6\%). The presence of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI signal abnormalities in more than 3 brain lobes (odds ratio [OR], 25.71; 95\% CI, 1.21-554.42), age older than 60 years (OR, 7.62; 95\% CI, 2.02-28.91), and the presence of diffusionweighted MRI signal abnormalities in the left thalamus (OR, 6.90; 95\% CI, 1.12-43.00) were independently associated with poor outcome. Machine learning models identified bilateral diffusion abnormalities as an additional factor associated with poor outcome (34 of 39 patients [87.2\%] with bilateral abnormalities had poor outcomes) and confirmed the functional burden of left thalamic lesions, particularly in older patients (all 11 patients aged {$>$}60 years had left thalamic lesions). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that in adult patients with HSE requiring ICU admission, extensive MRI changes in the brain are independently associated with poor functional},

  abstract = {Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is a physiological mechanism that maintains constant cerebral blood flow regardless of changes in cerebral perfusion pressure and prevents brain damage caused by hypoperfusion or hyperperfusion. In recent decades, researchers have investigated the range of systemic blood pressures and clinical management strategies over which cerebral vasculature modifies intracranial hemodynamics to maintain cerebral perfusion. However, proposed clinical interventions to optimize autoregulation status have not demonstrated clear clinical benefit. As future trials are designed, it is crucial to comprehend the underlying cause of our inability to produce robust clinical evidence supporting the concept of CA-targeted management. This article examines the technological advances in monitoring techniques and the accuracy of continuous assessment of autoregulation techniques used in intraoperative and intensive care settings today. It also examines how increasing knowledge of CA from recent clinical trials contributes to a greater understanding of secondary brain injury in many disease processes, despite the fact that the lack of robust evidence influencing outcomes has prevented the translation of CA-guided algorithms into clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Elevated blood pressure (BP), which presents in approximately 80~\% of patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), is associated with increased risk of poor outcome. The Second Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Haemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2) study, a multinational, multicenter, randomized controlled trial published in 2013, demonstrated better functional outcomes with no harm for patients with acute spontaneous ICH within 6~h of onset who received target-driven, early intensive BP lowering (systolic BP target {$<$}140~mmHg within 1~h, continued for 7~days) and suggested that greater and faster reduction in BP might enhance the treatment effect by limiting hematoma growth. The trial resulted in revisions of guidelines for acute management of ICH, in which intensive BP lowering in patients with acute ICH is recommended as safe and effective treatment for improving functional outcome. BP lowering is also the only intervention that is proven to reduce the risk of recurrent ICH. Current evidences from several randomized trials, including PROGRESS and SPS3, indicate that long-term strict BP control in patients with ICH is safe and could offer additional benefits in major reduction in risk of recurrent ICH. The latest American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines recommended a target BP of {$<$}130/80~mmHg after ICH, but supporting evidence is limited. Randomized controlled trials are needed that focus on strict BP control, initiated early after onset of the disease and continued long-term, to demonstrate effective prevention of recurrent stroke and other major vascular events without additional harms in the ICH population.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate whether IV high-dose vitamin C improves the short-term mortality of patients with sepsis. DESIGN: This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. We searched EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and MEDLINE for randomized controlled trials that met inclusion criteria. The protocol was registered at the University hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000040528). All analyses were presented with the use of random-effects models. The primary outcome was short-term mortality defined as 28-day, 30-day, or in-hospital mortality. PATIENTS: Two authors independently evaluated the following eligibility criteria: 1) randomized controlled trial, 2) patients with sepsis aged {$\geq$}18 years, and 3) received intravenous high-dose vitamin C in addition to standard of care, or standard of care alone. Then, two authors independently extracted the selected patient and study characteristics and outcomes from studies that met above eligibility criteria. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eleven randomized controlled trials (n = 1,737 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. High-dose IV vitamin C was not associated with a significantly lower short-term mortality (risk ratio, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.73\textendash 1.06; p = 0.18; I2 = 29\%) but was associated with a significantly shorter duration of vasopressor use (standardized mean difference, \textendash 0.35; 95\% CI, \textendash 0.63 to \textendash 0.07; p {$<$} 0.01; I2 = 80\%) and a significantly greater decline in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at 72\textendash 96 hours (standardized mean difference, \textendash 0.20; 95\% CI, \textendash 0.32 to \textendash 0.08; p {$<$} 0.01; I2 = 16\%). One study reported significant association with hypernatremia, but adverse effects were rare, and high-dose vitamin C is deemed relatively safe. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, the use of IV high-dose vitamin C in patients with sepsis was not associated with lower short-term mortality although it was associated with significantly shorter duration of vasopressor use and greater decline in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at 72\textendash 96 hours.},

We aimed to determine the relationship between laterality of acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and poor clinical outcomes. Methods A subsidiary analysis of the INTERACT Pilot and INTERACT2 studies\textemdash randomised controlled trials of patients with spontaneous acute ICH with elevated systolic blood pressure (BP), randomly assigned to intensive (target systolic BP {$<$}140 mm Hg) or guideline-based ({$<$}180 mm Hg) BP management. Outcomes were the combined and separate end points of death and major disability (modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores of 3\textendash 6, 6 and 3\textendash 5, respectively) at 90 days. Results A total of 2708 patients had supratentorial/hemispheric ICH and information on mRS at 90 days. Patients with right hemispheric ICH (1327, 49\%) had a higher risk of death at 90 days compared to those with left hemispheric ICH after adjustment for potential confounding variables (OR, 1.77 (95\% CI 1.33 to 2.37)). There were no differences between patients with right and left hemispheric ICH regarding the combined end point of death or major disability or major disability in the multivariable-adjusted models (1.07 (0.89 to 1.29) and 0.85 (0.72 to 1.01), respectively). Conclusions Right hemispheric lesion was associated with increased risk of death in patients with acute ICH. The laterality of the ICH does not appear to affect the level of disability in survivors.

  abstract = {Mediation analysis explores the degree to which an exposure's effect on an outcome is diverted through a mediating variable. We describe a classical regression framework for conducting mediation analyses in which estimates of causal mediation effects and their variance are obtained from the fit of a single regression model. The vector of changes in exposure pathway coefficients, which we named the essential mediation components (EMCs), is used to estimate standard causal mediation effects. Because these effects are often simple functions of the EMCs, an analytical expression for their model-based variance follows directly. Given this formula, it is instructive to revisit the performance of routinely used variance approximations (e.g., delta method and resampling methods). Requiring the fit of only one model reduces the computation time required for complex mediation analyses and permits the use of a rich suite of regression tools that are not easily implemented on a system of three equations, as would be required in the Baron\textendash Kenny framework. Using data from the BRAIN-ICU study, we provide examples to illustrate the advantages of this framework and compare it with the existing approaches.},

The Swiss SOS (Swiss Study on Subarachnoid Hemorrhage) was established in 2008 and offers the unique opportunity to provide this data from the point of care on a nationwide level. METHODS: All patients with confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014, within Switzerland were recorded in a prospective registry. Incidence rates were calculated based on time-matched population data. Admission parameters and outcomes at discharge and at 1 year were recorded. RESULTS: We recorded data of 1787 consecutive patients. The incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in Switzerland was 3.7 per 100\,000 persons/y. The number of female patients was 1170 (65.5\%). With a follow-up rate of 91.3\% at 1 year, 1042 patients (58.8\%) led an independent life according to the modified Rankin Scale (0\textendash 2). About 1 in 10 patients survived in a dependent state (modified Rankin Scale, 3\textendash 5; n=185; 10.4\%). Case fatality was 20.1\% (n=356) at discharge and 22.1\% (n=391) after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: The current incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in Switzerland is lower than expected and an indication of a global trend toward decreasing admissions for ruptured intracranial aneurysms.},

  abstract = {DAMPs are integral in the early coordination of the innate immune system in a variety of acute illnesses. Specifically, they convey danger to other cells, trigger inflammation, and activate the innate immune system to stop further damage. DAMPs also organize tissue healing and participate in communication to inform the appropriate adaptive immune response (14, 54). The knowledge the immune system responds similarly to traumatic, ischemic, and pathogen-associated threats offers great insight into the clinical characteristics of the patients seen under our care. This is indeed an attractive theory that both share the same pathway. It is also clear that controlled release and activation of the immune system is needed to appropriately respond to danger. These responses are designed to clear damaged cells and to stop potential invasion of pathogens through lost barrier integrity (5, 14, 53). The overwhelming, exuberant, and dysregulated response could be modified for clinical benefit (97). However, even with our rudimentary understanding of DAMP release and immune activation the task is daunting. Multiple DAMPs are released with cell death and in turn activate many receptors with redundant pathways leading to immune coordination. Several trials that have blocked the best studied PAMP/TLR interaction (lipopolysaccharide and TLR4) have been unsuccessful in modifying further cytokine release or improving patient-centered outcomes (98, 99). Under normal conditions, most molecules that can act as DAMPs exist in the organism and are essential for its continued survival. Therefore, a key aspect of futures studies will be targeting these molecules specifically in their role as DAMPs but without hindering their normal role in the body. In the near term, it is not clear who could benefit from modulation of these responses in the acute setting. Indiscriminant blocking of the immune response with our current understanding of the basic science is unlikely to help patients (100, 101).},

This subphenotype of rapidly improving ARDS has not been well characterized. We attempted to assess the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of rapidly improving ARDS and to identify which variables are useful to predict it. METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of patient level data from six ARDS Network~randomized controlled trials. We defined rapidly improving ARDS, contrasted with ARDS {$>$} 1~day, as extubation or a Pao2 to Fio2 ratio (Pao2:Fio2) {$>$} 300 on the first study day following enrollment. RESULTS: The prevalence of rapidly improving ARDS was 10.5\%~(458 of 4,361 patients) and increased over time. Of the 1,909 patients enrolled in the three most recently published trials, 197 (10.3\%) were extubated on the first study day, and 265 (13.9\%) in total had rapidly improving ARDS. Patients with rapidly improving ARDS had lower baseline severity of~illness and lower 60-day mortality (10.2\%~vs~26.3\%; P~{$<$} .0001) than ARDS {$>~$}1~day. Pao2:Fio2 at screening, change in Pao2:Fio2 from screening to enrollment, use of vasopressor agents, Fio2 at enrollment, and serum bilirubin levels were useful predictive variables. CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly improving ARDS, mostly defined by early extubation, is an increasingly prevalent and distinct subphenotype, associated with better outcomes than ARDS {$>$} 1~day. Enrollment of patients with rapidly improving ARDS may negatively affect the prognostic enrichment and contribute to the failure of therapeutic trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) are treated with supplemental oxygen, but the benefits and harms of different oxygenation targets are unclear. We hypothesized that using a lower target for partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) would result in lower mortality than using a higher target. METHODS: In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 2928 adult patients who had recently been admitted to the ICU ({$\leq$}12 hours before randomization) and who were receiving at least 10 liters of oxygen per minute in an open system or had a fraction of inspired oxygen of at least 0.50 in a closed system to receive oxygen therapy targeting a Pao2 of either 60 mm Hg (lower-oxygenation group) or 90 mm Hg (higher-oxygenation group) for a maximum of 90 days. The primary outcome was death within 90 days. RESULTS: At 90 days, 618 of 1441 patients (42.9\%) in the lower-oxygenation group and 613 of 1447 patients (42.4\%) in the higher-oxygenation group had died (adjusted risk ratio, 1.02; 95\% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.11; P\,=\,0.64). At 90 days, there was no significant between-group difference in the percentage of days that patients were alive without life support or in the percentage of days they were alive after hospital discharge. The percentages of patients who had new episodes of shock, myocardial ischemia, ischemic stroke, or intestinal ischemia were similar in the two groups (P\,=\,0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Among adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the ICU, a lower oxygenation target did not result in lower mortality than a higher target at 90 days.

  abstract = {Many modern estimators require bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals because either no analytic standard error is available or the distribution of the parameter of interest is non-symmetric. It remains however unclear how to obtain valid bootstrap inference when dealing with multiple imputation to address missing data. We present four methods which are intuitively appealing, easy to implement, and combine bootstrap estimation with multiple imputation. We show that three of the four approaches yield valid inference, but that the performance of the methods varies with respect to the number of imputed data sets and the extent of missingness. Simulation studies reveal the behavior of our approaches in finite samples. A topical analysis from HIV treatment research, which determines the optimal timing of antiretroviral treatment initiation in young children, demonstrates the practical implications of the four methods in a sophisticated and realistic setting. This analysis suffers from missing data and uses the \$g\$-formula for inference, a method for which no standard errors are available.},

We discuss how DAGs can also be used to encode theoretical assumptions about nonprobability samples and survey nonresponse and to determine whether population quantities including conditional distributions and regressions can be identified. We describe sources of bias and assumptions for eliminating it in various selection scenarios. We then introduce and analyze graphical representations of multiple selection stages in the data collection process, and highlight the strong assumptions implicit in using only design weights. Furthermore, we show that the common practice of selecting adjustment variables based on correlations with sample selection and outcome variables of interest is ill-justified and that nonresponse weighting when the interest is in causal inference may come at severe costs. Finally, we identify further areas for survey methodology research that can benefit from advances in causal graph theory.},

Objective: The goal of this study was to explore how family members, nurses, and physicians experience the palliative and supportive care needs of patients with SABI receiving care in the neuroscience intensive care unit (neuro-ICU). Design: Semistructured interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Setting/Subjects: Thirty-bed neuro-ICU in a regional comprehensive stroke and level-one trauma center in the United States. We completed 47 interviews regarding 15 patients with family members (n\,=\,16), nurses (n\,=\,15), and physicians (n\,=\,16). Results: Two themes were identified: (1) hope and (2) personhood. (1) Families linked prognostic uncertainty to a need for hope and expressed a desire for physicians to acknowledge this relationship. The language of hope varied depending on the participant: clinicians used hope as an object that can be given or taken away, generally in the process of conveying prognosis, while families expressed hope as an action that supported coping with their loved one's acute illness and its prognostic uncertainty. (2) Participants described the loss of personhood through brain injury, the need to recognize and treat the brain-injured patient as a person, and the importance of relatedness and connection, including personal support of families by clinicians. Conclusions: Support for hope and preservation of personhood challenge care in the neuro-ICU as identified by families and clinicians of patients with SABI. Specific practical approaches can address these challenges and improve the palliative care provided to patients and families in the neuro-ICU.},

Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to November 28, 2021, for randomized trials and observational studies reporting propensity score-\-matched data and comparing adults with out-o\- f-h\- ospital cardiac arrest treated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation with those treated with conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

  abstract = {Introduction Data on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is limited in Italy, and there has never been a comprehensive systematic appraisal of the available evidence. Therefore, this review aims to explore the incidence, characteristics, and outcome of OHCA in Italy. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and conference proceedings up to September 23, 2022. Studies investigating OHCA in Italy and reporting at least one outcome related to cardiac arrest were considered eligible. The primary outcome was survival at the longest follow-up available. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. A random-effects model proportion meta-analysis was performed to calculate the pooled outcomes with 95\% confidence interval (CI). Results We included 42 studies (43,042 patients) from 13 of the 20 Italian regions published between 1995 and 2022. Only five studies were deemed to be at low risk of bias. The overall average incidences of OHCA attended by emergency medical services and with resuscitation attempted were 86 (range: 10\textendash 190) and 55 (range: 6\textendash 108) per 100,000 populations per year, respectively. Survival at the longest follow-up available was 9.0\% (95\% CI, 6.7\textendash 12\%; 30 studies and 15,195 patients) in the overall population, 25\% (95\% CI, 21\textendash 30\%; 16 studies and 2,863 patients) among patients with shockable rhythms, 28\% (95\% CI, 20\textendash 37\%; 8 studies and 1,292 patients) among the Utstein comparator group. Favourable neurological outcome was 5.0\% (95\% CI, 3.6\textendash 6.6\%; 16 studies and 9,675 patients). Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 19\% (95\% CI, 16\textendash 23\%; 40 studies and 30,875 patients) of cases. Bystanders initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 26\% (95\% CI, 21\textendash 32\%; 33 studies and 23,491 patients) of cases but only in 3.2\% (95\% CI, 1.9\textendash 4.9\%; 9 studies and 8,508 patients) with an automated external defibrillator. The mean response time was 10.2 (95\% CI, 8.9\textendash 11.4; 25 studies and 23,997 patients) minutes. Conclusions Survival after OHCA in Italy occurred in one of every ten patients. Bystanders initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation in only one-third of cases, rarely with a defibrillator. Different areas of the country collected data, but an essential part of the population was not included. There was high heterogeneity and large variation in outcomes results and reporting, limiting the confidence in the estimates of incidence and outcome. Creating and maintaining a nationwide registry is a priority.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To measure low-value health care use within health systems in the US and explore features of the health systems associated with low-value care delivery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional analysis, we identified occurrences of 17 low-value services in 3745 hospitals and affiliated outpatient sites. Hospitals were linked to 676 health systems in the US using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Compendium of Health Systems. The participants were 100\% of Medicare beneficiaries with claims from 2016 to 2018. EXPOSURES We identified occurrences of 17 low-value services in 3839 hospitals and affiliated outpatient sites. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hospitals were linked to health systems using AHRQ's Compendium of Health Systems. Between March and August 2021, we modeled overuse occurrences with a negative binomial regression model including the year-quarter, procedure indicator, and a health system indicator. The model included random effects for hospital and beneficiary age, sex, and comorbidity count specific to each indicator, hospital, and quarter. The beta coefficients associated with the health system term, normalized, reflect the tendency of that system to use low-value services relative to all other systems. With ordinary least squares regression, we explored health system characteristics associated with the Overuse Index (OI), expressed as a standard deviation where the mean across all health systems is 0. RESULTS There were 676 unique health systems assessed in our study that included from 1 to 163 hospitals (median of 2). The mean age of eligible beneficiaries was 75.5 years and 76\% were women. Relative to the lowest tertile, health systems in the upper tertile of medical groups count and bed count had an OI that was higher by 0.38 standard deviations (SD) and 0.44 SD, respectively. Health systems that were primarily investor owned had an OI that was 0.56 SD higher than those that were not investor owned. Relative to the lowest tertile, health systems in the upper tertile of primary care physicians, upper tertile of teaching intensity, and upper quartile of uncompensated care had an OI that was lower by 0.59 SD, 0.45 SD, and 0.47 SD, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study of US health systems, higher amounts of overuse among health systems were associated with investor ownership and fewer primary care physicians. The OI is a valuable tool for identifying potentially modifiable drivers of overuse and is adaptable to other levels of investigation, such as the state or region, which might be affected by local policies affecting payment or system consolidation.},

  abstract = {Clinicians monitor mechanical ventilatory support using airway pressures\textemdash primarily the plateau and driving pressure, which are considered by many to determine the safety of the applied tidal volume. These airway pressures are influenced not only by the ventilator prescription, but also by the mechanical properties of the respiratory system, which consists of the series-coupled lung and chest wall. Actively limiting chest wall expansion through external compression of the rib cage or abdomen is seldom performed in the ICU. Recent literature describing the respiratory mechanics of patients with late-stage, unresolving, ARDS, however, has raised awareness of the potential diagnostic (and perhaps therapeutic) value of this unfamiliar and somewhat counterintuitive practice. In these patients, interventions that reduce resting lung volume, such as loading the chest wall through application of external weights or manual pressure, or placing the torso in a more horizontal position, have unexpectedly improved tidal compliance of the lung and integrated respiratory system by reducing previously undetected end-tidal hyperinflation. In this interpretive review, we first describe underappreciated lung and chest wall interactions that are clinically relevant to both normal individuals and to the acutely ill who receive ventilatory support. We then apply these physiologic principles, in addition to published clinical observation, to illustrate the utility of chest wall modification for the purposes of detecting end-tidal hyperinflation in everyday practice.},

Specification Curve Analysis is a tool intended to prevent selective reporting. Alas, when used for inference it can create severe biases and false positives, due to wrongly adjusting for covariates, and mask important treatment effect heterogeneity. As our motivating application, it led an influential study to conclude there is no relevant association between technology use and teenager mental well-being. We discuss these issues and propose a strategy for valid inference. Bayesian Specification Curve Analysis (BSCA) uses Bayesian Model Averaging to incorporate covariates and heterogeneous effects across treatments, outcomes and subpopulations. BSCA gives significantly different insights into teenager well-being, revealing that the association with technology differs by device, gender and who assesses well-being (teenagers or their parents).},

  abstract = {Intravenous fluid therapy is the most common intervention received by acutely ill patients. Historically, saline (0.9\% sodium chloride) has been the most frequently administered intravenous fluid, especially in North America. Balanced crystalloid solutions (e.g., lactated Ringer's, Plasma-Lyte) are an increasingly used alternative to saline. Balanced crystalloids have a sodium, potassium, and chloride content closer to that of extracellular fluid and, when given intravenously, have fewer adverse effects on acid\textendash base balance. Preclinical research has demonstrated that saline may cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, inflammation, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and death. Studies of patients and healthy human volunteers suggest that even relatively small volumes of saline may exert physiological effects. Randomized trials in the operating room have demonstrated that using balanced crystalloids rather than saline prevents the development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may reduce the need for vasopressors. Observational studies among critically ill adults have associated receipt of balanced crystalloids with lower rates of complications, including acute kidney injury and death. Most recently, large randomized trials among critically ill adults have examined whether balanced crystalloids result in less death or severe renal dysfunction than saline. Although some of these trials are still ongoing, a growing body of evidence raises fundamental concerns regarding saline as the primary intravenous crystalloid for critically ill adults and highlights fundamental unanswered questions for future research about fluid therapy in critical illness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Both balanced crystalloids and saline are used for intravenous fluid administration in critically ill adults, but it is not known which results in better clinical outcomes. METHODS In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial conducted in five intensive care units at an academic center, we assigned 15,802 adults to receive saline (0.9\% sodium chloride) or balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) according to the randomization of the unit to which they were admitted. The primary outcome was a major adverse kidney event within 30 days \textemdash{} a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to {$\geq$}200\% of baseline) \textemdash{} all censored at hospital discharge or 30 days, whichever occurred first. RESULTS Among the 7942 patients in the balanced-crystalloids group, 1139 (14.3\%) had a major adverse kidney event, as compared with 1211 of 7860 patients (15.4\%) in the saline group (marginal odds ratio, 0.91; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 0.99; conditional odds ratio, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 0.99; P\,=\,0.04). In-hospital mortality at 30 days was 10.3\% in the balanced-crystalloids group and 11.1\% in the saline group (P\,=\,0.06). The incidence of new renal-replacement therapy was 2.5\% and 2.9\%, respectively (P\,=\,0.08), and the incidence of persistent renal dysfunction was 6.4\% and 6.6\%, respectively (P\,=\,0.60).

The Major Adverse Kidney Events by 30~days (MAKE30) composite of death, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction is recommended as a patient-centered outcome for pragmatic trials involving acute kidney injury. Accurate electronic detection of the MAKE30 endpoint using data within the electronic health record (EHR) could facilitate the use of the EHR in large-scale kidney injury research. In an observational study using prospectively collected data from 200 admissions to a single medical intensive care unit, we tested the performance of electronically-extracted data in identifying the MAKE30 composite compared to the reference standard of two-physician manual chart review. The incidence of MAKE30 on manual-review was 16~\%, which included 8.5~\% for in-hospital mortality, 3.5~\% for new renal replacement therapy, and 8.5~\% for persistent renal dysfunction. There was strong agreement between the electronic and manual assessment of MAKE30 (98.5~\% agreement [95~\% CI 96.5-100.0~\%]; kappa 0.95 [95~\% CI 0.87-1.00]; P\,{$<$}\,0.001), with only three patients misclassified by electronic assessment. Performance of the electronic MAKE30 assessment was similar among patients with and without CKD and with and without a measured serum creatinine in the 12~months prior to hospital admission. In summary, accurately identifying the MAKE30 composite outcome using EHR data collected as a part of routine care appears feasible.},

This before-and-after study evaluated the outcomes associated with an implementation intervention promoting use of lactated Ringer solution rather than saline solution among nearly 150\,000 patients across 22 hospitals. The intervention used education and changes to the electronic order entry system to affect which fluid patients received beginning immediately at hospital presentation. The proportion of intravenous fluid administered that was lactated Ringer increased (from approximately 25\% to 75\%) and the use of saline decreased (from approximately 75\% to 25\%). In interrupted time series analysis, implementation of lactated Ringer was associated with a 2\% absolute risk reduction in death, new receipt of kidney replacement therapy, or persistent kidney dysfunction. This effect size was greater for patients with sepsis and patients who received more fluid. This study raises important questions about the choice between lactated Ringer and saline and, more broadly, how we should make evidence-based choices between widely available, commonly used treatment alternatives in acute care.},

  abstract = {Sepsis is a common syndrome with substantial morbidity and mortality. A combination of vitamin C, thiamine, and corticosteroids has been proposed as a potential treatment for patients with sepsis.To determine whether a combination of vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone every 6 hours increases ventilator- and vasopressor-free days compared with placebo in patients with sepsis.Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, adaptive-sample-size, placebo-controlled trial conducted in adult patients with sepsis-induced respiratory and/or cardiovascular dysfunction. Participants were enrolled in the emergency departments or intensive care units at 43 hospitals in the United States between August 2018 and July 2019. After enrollment of 501 participants, funding was withheld, leading to an administrative termination of the trial. All study-related follow-up was completed by January 2020.Participants were randomized to receive intravenous vitamin C (1.5 g), thiamine (100 mg), and hydrocortisone (50 mg) every 6 hours (n\,=\,252) or matching placebo (n\,=\,249) for 96 hours or until discharge from the intensive care unit or death. Participants could be treated with open-label corticosteroids by the clinical team, with study hydrocortisone or matching placebo withheld if the total daily dose was greater or equal to the equivalent of 200 mg of hydrocortisone.The primary outcome was the number of consecutive ventilator- and vasopressor-free days in the first 30 days following the day of randomization. The key secondary outcome was 30-day mortality.Among 501 participants randomized (median age, 62 [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 50-70] years; 46\% female; 30\% Black; median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, 27 [IQR, 20.8-33.0]; median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, 9 [IQR, 7-12]), all completed the trial. Open-label corticosteroids were prescribed to 33\% and 32\% of the intervention and control groups, respectively. Ventilator- and vasopressor-free days were a median of 25 days (IQR, 0-29 days) in the intervention group and 26 days (IQR, 0-28 days) in the placebo group, with a median difference of -1 day (95\% CI, -4 to 2 days; P\,=\,.85). Thirty-day mortality was 22\% in the intervention group and 24\% in the placebo group.Among critically ill patients with sepsis, treatment with vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone, compared with placebo, did not significantly increase ventilator- and vasopressor-free days within 30 days. However, the trial was terminated early for administrative reasons and may have been underpowered to detect a clinically important difference.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03509350},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe 1-year recovery trajectories among ICH and IVH survivors with initial severe disability and assess the association of hospital events with long-term recovery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This post hoc analysis pooled all individual patient data from the Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage phase 3 trial (CLEAR-III) and the Minimally Invasive Surgery Plus Alteplase for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Evacuation (MISTIE-III) phase 3 trial in multiple centers across the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Patients were enrolled from August 1, 2010, to September 30, 2018, with a follow-up duration of 1 year. Of 999 enrolled patients, 724 survived with a day 30 modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 4 to 5 after excluding 13 participants with missing day 30 mRS. An additional 9 patients were excluded because of missing 1-year mRS. The final pooled cohort included 715 patients (71.6\%) with day 30 mRS 4 to 5. Data were analyzed from July 2019 to January 2022. EXPOSURES CLEAR-III participants randomized to intraventricular alteplase vs placebo. MISTIE-III participants randomized to stereotactic thrombolysis of hematoma vs standard medical care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was 1-year mRS. Patients were dichotomized into good outcome at 1 year (mRS 0 to 3) vs poor outcome at 1 year (mRS 4 to 6). Multivariable logistic regression models assessed associations between prospectively adjudicated hospital events and 1-year good outcome after adjusting for demographic characteristics, ICH and IVH severity, and trial cohort. RESULTS Of 715 survivors, 417 (58\%) were male, and the overall mean (SD) age was 60.3 (11.7) years. Overall, 174 participants (24.3\%) were Black, 491 (68.6\%) were White, and 49 (6.9\%) were of other races (including Asian, Native American, and Pacific Islander, consolidated owing to small numbers); 98 (13.7\%) were of Hispanic ethnicity. By 1 year, 129 participants (18\%) had died and 308 (43\%) had achieved mRS 0 to 3. In adjusted models for the combined cohort, diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.50; 95\% CI, 0.26-0.96), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (aOR, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.90-0.96), severe leukoaraiosis (aOR, 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.16-0.54), pineal gland shift (aOR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.76-0.99]), acute ischemic stroke (aOR, 0.44; 95\% CI, 0.21-0.94), gastrostomy (aOR, 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.17-0.50), and persistent hydrocephalus by day 30 (aOR, 0.37; 95\% CI, 0.14-0.98) were associated with lack of recovery. Resolution of ICH (aOR, 1.82; 95\% CI, 1.08-3.04) and IVH (aOR, 2.19; 95\% CI, 1.02-4.68) by day 30 were associated with recovery to good outcome. In the CLEAR-III model, cerebral perfusion pressure less than 60 mm Hg (aOR, 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.13-0.71), sepsis (aOR, 0.05; 95\% CI, 0.00-0.80), and prolonged mechanical ventilation (aOR, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.92-1.00 per day), and in MISTIE-III, need for intracranial pressure monitoring (aOR, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.12-0.98), were additional factors associated with poor outcome. Thirty-day event-based models strongly predicted 1-year outcome (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.83\textendash 0.90), with significantly improved discrimination over models using baseline severity factors alone (AUC, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.71-0.80; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among survivors of severe ICH and IVH with initial poor functional outcome, more than 40\% recovered to good outcome by 1 year. Hospital events were strongly associated with long-term functional recovery and may be potential targets for intervention. Avoiding early pessimistic prognostication and delaying prognostication until after treatment may improve ability to predict future recovery.},

  abstract = {Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is one of the most important complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Despite lack of prospective evidence, medical rescue interventions for DCI include hemodynamic augmentation using vasopressors or inotropes, with limited guidance on specific blood pressure and hemodynamic parameters. For DCI refractory to medical interventions, endovascular rescue therapies (ERTs), including intraarterial (IA) vasodilators and percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty, are the cornerstone of management. Although there are no randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of ERTs for DCI and their impact on subarachnoid hemorrhage outcomes, survey studies suggest that they are widely used in clinical practice with significant variability worldwide. IA vasodilators are first line ERTs, with better safety profiles and access to distal vasculature. The most commonly used IA vasodilators include calcium channel blockers, with milrinone gaining popularity in more recent publications. Balloon angioplasty achieves better vasodilation compared with IA vasodilators but is associated with higher risk of life-threatening vascular complications and is reserved for proximal severe refractory vasospasm. The existing literature on DCI rescue therapies is limited by small sample sizes, significant variability in patient populations, lack of standardized methodology, variable definitions of DCI, poorly reported outcomes, lack of long-term functional, cognitive, and patient-centered outcomes, and lack of control groups. Therefore, our current ability to interpret clinical results and make reliable recommendations regarding the use of rescue therapies is limited. This review summarizes existing literature on rescue therapies for DCI, provides practical guidance, and identifies future research needs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of endovascular therapy (EVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke who have large vessel occlusion has rapidly increased in the United States following pivotal trials demonstrating its benefit. Information about the contribution of interhospital transfer in improving access to EVT will help organize regional systems of stroke care. METHODS: We analyzed trends of transfer-in EVT from a cohort of 1\,863\,693 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to 2143 Get With The GuidelinesStroke participating hospitals between January 2012 and December 2017. We further examined the association between arrival mode and in-hospital outcomes by using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of the 37\,260 patients who received EVT at 639 hospitals during the study period, 42.9\% (15\,975) arrived at the EVT-providing hospital after interhospital transfer. Transfer-in EVT cases increased from 256 in the first quarter 2012 to 1422 in the fourth quarter 2017, with sharply accelerated increases following the fourth quarter 2014 (P{$<$}0.001 for change in linear trend). Transfer-in patients were younger and more likely to be of white race, to arrive during off-hours, and to be treated at comprehensive stroke centers. Transfer-in patients had significantly longer last-known-well-to-EVT initiation time (median, 289 minutes versus 213 minutes; absolute standardized difference, 67.33) but were more likely to have door-to-EVT initiation time of {$\leq$}90 minutes (65.6\% versus 23.6\%; absolute standardized difference, 93.18). In-hospital outcomes were worse for transfer-in patients undergoing EVT in unadjusted and in risk-adjusted models. Although the difference in in-hospital mortality disappeared after adjusting for delay in EVT initiation (14.7\% versus 13.4\%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.01; 95\% CI, 0.92\textendash 1.11), transfer-in patients were still more likely to develop symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7.0\% versus 5.7\%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.15; 95\% CI, 1.02\textendash 1.29) and less likely to have either independent ambulation at discharge (33.1\% versus 37.1\%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.80\textendash 0.95) or to be discharged to home (24.3\% versus 29.1\%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.76\textendash 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Interhospital transfer for EVT is increasingly common and is associated with a significant delay in EVT initiation highlighting the need to develop more efficient stroke systems of care. Further evaluation to identify factors that impact EVT outcomes for transfer-in patients is warranted.},

  abstract = {Large quantities of data are now available to medical researchers; however, observational studies are plagued by bias and confounding. Additionally, much of this research only speculates on variable associations, leaving prospective randomized clinical trials as the sole purveyors of claims about causal relations between variables. There has been a growing movement of causal inference that uses new techniques to investigate causality using observational data. These techniques include the implementation of directed acyclic graphs, which allow researchers to explicitly and reproducibly define the causal relationships between study variables, thus making statistical analysis more robust. Directed acyclic graphs further allow researchers to identify confounding and other sources of bias and to discover causal effects among complex networks of variables. This review aims to introduce these techniques to the general urology and urologic oncology research communities in order to provide a basic understanding of causal inference and analysis and call for integration of these practices more generally in research methodology.},

Background:~         0.9\% saline, which results in a hyperchloremic acidosis after infusion, is frequently used to replace volume losses after major surgery.         Methods:~         An observational study using the Premier Perspective Comparative Database was performed to evaluate adult patients undergoing major open abdominal surgery who received either 0.9\% saline (30,994 patients) or a balanced crystalloid solution (926 patients) on the day of surgery. The primary outcome was major morbidity and secondary outcomes included minor complications and acidosis-related interventions. Outcomes were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression and propensity scoring models.         Results:~         For the entire cohort, the in-hospital mortality was 5.6\% in the saline group and 2.9\% in the balanced group (P {$<$} 0.001). One or more major complications occurred in 33.7\% of the saline group and 23\% of the balanced group (P {$<$} 0.001). In the 3:1 propensity-matched sample, treatment with balanced fluid was associated with fewer complications (odds ratio 0.79; 95\% confidence interval 0.66\textendash 0.97). Postoperative infection (P = 0.006), renal failure requiring dialysis (P {$<$} 0.001), blood transfusion (P {$<$} 0.001), electrolyte disturbance (P = 0.046), acidosis investigation (P {$<$} 0.001), and intervention (P = 0.02) were all more frequent in patients receiving 0.9\% saline.         Conclusions:~         Among hospitals in the Premier Perspective Database, the use of a calcium-free balanced crystalloid for replacement of fluid losses on the day of major surgery was associated with less postoperative morbidity than 0.9\% saline.},

  abstract = {Ventilatory management of acute respiratory distress syndrome has evolved significantly in the last few decades. The aims have shifted from optimal gas transfer without concern for iatrogenic risks to adequate gas transfer while minimizing lung injury. This change in focus, along with improved ventilator and multiorgan system management, has resulted in a significant improvement in patient outcomes. Despite this, a number of patients develop hypoxemic respiratory failure refractory to lung-protective ventilation (LPV). The intensivist then faces the dilemma of either persisting with LPV using adjuncts (neuromuscular blocking agents, prone positioning, recruitment maneuvers, inhaled nitric oxide, inhaled prostacyclin, steroids, and surfactant) or making a transition to rescue therapies such as high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) when both these modalities are at their disposal. The lack of quality evidence and potential harm reported in recent studies question the use of HFOV as a routine rescue option. Based on current literature, the role for venovenous (VV) ECMO is probably sequential as a salvage therapy to ensure ultraprotective ventilation in selected young patients with potentially reversible respiratory failure who fail LPV despite neuromuscular paralysis and prone ventilation. Given the risk profile and the economic impact, future research should identify the patients who benefit most from VV ECMO. These choices may be further influenced by the emerging novel extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal devices that can compliment LPV. Given the heterogeneity of acute respiratory distress syndrome, each of these modalities may play a role in an individual patient. Future studies comparing LPV, HFOV, and VV ECMO should not only focus on defining the patients who benefit most from each of these therapies but also consider long-term functional outcomes.},

Participants were a 5\% random sample of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries discharged to community HHC after SNF stay from 2014 to 2016 with continuous part A and B enrollment in the prior 6 months. Medicare claims data from 2014 to 2016 were used, including inpatient, SNF, hospice, HHC, outpatient, carrier, and durable medical equipment data and Minimum Data Set (MDS) and Outcome Assessment Information Set (OASIS) for SNF and HHC assessments, respectively. Data were analyzed from July 20, 2020, to June 5, 2022.Frailty was measured with a validated claims\textendash based frailty index (CFI) (range, 0-1; higher scores indicate worse frailty) and categorized into not frail (\&lt;0.20), mildly frail (0.20-0.29), and moderately to severely frail ({$\geq$}0.30).The primary outcome was functional recovery, defined by discharge from HHC with stable or improved ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL). Recovery status was examined at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 days after discharge to HHC using OASIS. Covariates were obtained from the MDS admission file at SNF admission, including age, race and ethnicity, cognitive status, functional status, and geographic region.Among 105\,232 beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 79.1 [10.6] years; 68\,637 [65.2\%] women; 8951 Black [8.5\%], 3109 Hispanic [3.0\%], and 88\,583 White [84.2\%] individuals), 65\,796 individuals (62.5\%) were discharged from HHC services with improved function over 90 days of follow-up. Among 39\,436 beneficiaries not recovered, 19\,612 individuals (49.7\%) had mild frailty and 15\,818 individuals (40.1\%) had moderate to severe frailty. While 10\,492 of 17\,576 beneficiaries who were not frail recovered by 45 days (59.7\%), 10\,755 of 32\,212 individuals with moderate to severe frailty had recovered (33.4\%). Overall, frailty was negatively associated with functional recovery after adjustment for demographic characteristics, geographic census regions, and health-related variables, with a hazard ratio for moderate to severe frailty of 0.62 (95\% CI, 0.60-0.63) compared with nonfrailty.This study found that recovery after posthospitalization SNF stay was particularly prolonged for individuals with frailty. Functional dependence in activities of daily living remained common among individuals with frailty long after discharge home.},

While these atherosclerotic lesions are not associated with significant luminal stenosis ({$<$}50\%), the probability of finding such plaque exceeds chance and is more common in parent vessels rather than vessels supplying brain regions remote from infarction. More than 20\%\textendash 30\% of patients with unilateral hemispheric embolic stroke of undetermined source may be attributable to cervical internal or common carotid NSP. For these patients, randomized clinical trials have not shown a significant benefit of revascularization (endarterectomy or stenting), and optimal secondary prevention strategies rely on risk factor modification and antiplatelet therapy. Heightened awareness of this subtle finding may inform second-tier diagnostic testing recommendations for occult stroke mechanisms (eg, monitoring for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or hypercoagulability testing). Furthermore, recognition of NSP as a culprit lesion may lead to more targeted pharmacologic strategies aimed at stabilizing plaque. Recent guidelines have also incorporated evidence of plaque vulnerability (eg, intraplaque hemorrhage or lipid-rich necrotic core) in decision making regarding revascularization approaches. In this review, the epidemiology and management of NSP in patients with cryptogenic embolic infarction is summarized, with an emphasis on recognition of NSP such that future clinical trials can be designed to test novel interventional strategies against current medical management of embolic stroke of undetermined source.},

  abstract = {In the spring of 2021, reports of rare and unusual venous thrombosis in association with the ChAdOx1 and Ad26. COV2.S adenovirus-based coronavirus vaccines led to a brief suspension of their use by several countries. Thromboses in the cerebral and splanchnic veins among patients vaccinated in the preceding 4 weeks were described in 17 patients out of 7.98 million recipients of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (with 3 fatalities related to cerebral vein thrombosis) and 169 cases of cerebral vein thrombosis among 35 million ChAdOx1 recipients. Events were associated with thrombocytopenia and anti-PF4 (antibodies directed against platelet factor 4), leading to the designation vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Unlike the related heparin-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, with an estimated incidence of {$<$}1:1000 patients treated with heparin, and a mortality rate of 25\%, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia has been reported in 1:150\,000 ChAdOx1 recipients and 1:470\,000 Ad26.COV.2 recipients, with a reported mortality rate of 20\% to 30\%. Early recognition of this complication should prompt testing for anti-PF4 antibodies and acute treatment targeting the autoimmune and prothrombotic processes. Intravenous immunoglobulin (1 g/kg for 2 days), consideration of plasma exchange, and nonheparin anticoagulation (argatroban, fondaparinux) are recommended. In cases of cerebral vein thrombosis, one should monitor for and treat the known complications of venous congestion as they would in patients without vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Now that the Ad26.COV2.S has been reapproved for use in several countries, it remains a critical component of our pharmacological armamentarium in stopping the spread of the human coronavirus and should be strongly recommended to patients. At this time, the patient and community-level benefits of these two adenoviral vaccines vastly outweigh the rare but serious risks of vaccination. Due to the relatively low risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in young women ({$<$}50 years), it is reasonable to recommend an alternative vaccine if one is available. Ongoing postmarketing observational studies are important for tracking new vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia cases and other rare side effects of these emergent interventions.},

The authors performed a retrospective analysis in 86 consecutive patients with Fisher Grade 3 aSAH due to rupture of a supratentorial aneurysm who presented within 36 hours and were treated by surgical clipping within 48 hours of their ictus. Forty-three patients were managed postoperatively with a low-dose intravenous heparin infusion (Maryland low-dose intravenous heparin infusion protocol: 8 U/kg/hr progressing over 36 hours to 10 U/kg/hr) beginning 12 hours after surgery and continuing until Day 14 after the ictus. Forty-three control patients received conventional subcutaneous heparin twice daily as deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Results. Patients in the 2 groups were balanced in terms of baseline characteristics. In the heparin group, activated partial thromboplastin times were normal to mildly elevated; no clinically significant hemorrhages or instances of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or deep vein thrombosis were encountered. In the control group, the incidence of clinical vasospasm requiring rescue therapy (induced hypertension, selective intraarterial verapamil, and angioplasty) was 20 (47\%) of 43 patients, and 9 (21\%) of 43 patients experienced a delayed infarct on CT scanning. In the heparin group, the incidence of clinical vasospasm requiring rescue therapy was 9\% (4 of 43, p = 0.0002), and no patient suffered a delayed infarct (p = 0.003). Conclusions. In patients with Fisher Grade 3 aSAH whose aneurysm is secured, postprocedure use of a low-dose intravenous heparin infusion may be safe and beneficial.

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} In patients with spontaneous cerebellar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) guidelines advocate evacuation when the hematoma diameter is {$>$}\,3 cm. We studied outcome in patients with cerebellar ICH {$>$}\,3 cm who did not undergo immediate hematoma evacuation. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We included consecutive patients with cerebellar ICH {$>$}\,3 cm at two academic hospitals between 2008 and 2017. Patients who died {$<$}\,24 h (h) were excluded because of probable confounding by indication. We determined patient characteristics, hematoma volumes, EVD placement, secondary hematoma evacuation, in-hospital and 3-month case-fatality, and functional outcome. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Of 130 patients with cerebellar ICH, 98 (77\%) had a hematoma {$>$}\,3 cm of whom 22 (23\%) died {$<$}\,24 h and 28 (29\%) underwent hematoma evacuation {$<$}\,24 h. Thus, 48 patients were initially treated conservatively (mean age 70\,{$\pm$}\,13, 24 (50\%) female). Of these 48 patients, 7 (15\%) underwent secondary hematoma evacuation {$>$}\,24 h, of whom 1 (14\%) had received an EVD {$<$}\,24 h. Five others also received an EVD {$<$}\,24 h without subsequent hematoma evacuation. Of the 41 patients without secondary hematoma evacuation, 11 (28\%) died and 20 (51\%) had a favorable outcome (mRS of 0\textendash 3) at 3 months. The 7 patients who underwent secondary hematoma evacuation had a decrease in GCS score of at least two points prior to surgery; two (29\%) had deceased at 3 months; and 5 (71\%) had a good functional outcome (mRS 0\textendash 3). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} While cerebellar ICH {$>$}\,3 cm is often considered an indication for immediate hematoma evacuation, there may be a subgroup of patients in whom surgery can be safely deferred. Further data are needed to assess the optimal timing and indications of surgical treatment in these patients.},

However, in studies with an active comparator, the associations between predictors and censoring may differ across treatment groups. We used the clinical example of anticoagulation treatment with warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) in atrial fibrillation to illustrate this. The cohort of individuals initiating an oral anticoagulant during 2010\textendash 2016 was identified from the R\'egie de l'assurance maladie du Qu\'ebec (RAMQ) databases. The parameter of interest was the hazard ratio (HR) of the composite of stroke, major bleeding, myocardial infarction, or death associated with continuous use of warfarin versus DOACs. Two strategies for the specification of the model for estimation of censoring weights were explored: exposure-unstratified and exposure-stratified. The HR associated with continuous treatment with warfarin versus DOACs adjusted with exposure-stratified IPCWs was 1.26 (95\% confidence interval: 1.20, 1.33). Using exposure-unstratified IPCWs, the HR differed by 15\% in favor of DOACs (1.41, 95\% confidence interval: 1.34, 1.48). Not accounting for the different associations between the predictors and informative censoring across exposure groups may lead to misspecification of censoring weights and biased estimate on comparative effectiveness and safety.},

  abstract = {Background Failure to reliably diagnose ARDS may be a major driver of negative clinical trials and underrecognition and treatment in clinical practice. We sought to examine the interobserver reliability of the Berlin ARDS definition and examine strategies for improving the reliability of ARDS diagnosis. Methods Two hundred five patients with hypoxic respiratory failure from four ICUs were reviewed independently by three clinicians, who evaluated whether patients had ARDS, the diagnostic confidence of the reviewers, whether patients met individual ARDS criteria, and the time when criteria were met. Results Interobserver reliability of an ARDS diagnosis was ``moderate'' (kappa~= 0.50; 95\%~CI, 0.40-0.59). Sixty-seven percent of diagnostic disagreements between clinicians reviewing the same patient was explained by differences in how chest imaging studies were interpreted, with other ARDS criteria contributing less (identification of ARDS risk factor, 15\%; cardiac edema/volume overload exclusion, 7\%). Combining the independent reviews of three clinicians can increase reliability to ``substantial'' (kappa~= 0.75; 95\%~CI, 0.68-0.80). When a clinician diagnosed ARDS with ``high confidence,'' all other clinicians agreed with the diagnosis in 72\%~of reviews. There was close agreement between clinicians about the time when a patient met~all ARDS criteria if ARDS developed within the first 48 hours of hospitalization (median difference, 5 hours). Conclusions The reliability of the Berlin ARDS definition is moderate, driven primarily by differences in chest imaging interpretation. Combining independent reviews by multiple clinicians or improving methods to identify bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging are important strategies for improving the reliability of ARDS diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing\textemdash no deliberate cheating nor loafing\textemdash by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more `progeny,' such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.},

This study examines patient preferences for different outcomes of stroke, including death. We presented patients with written case scenarios of stroke outcomes. The scenarios represented four categories of stroke severity (mild, moderate, severe, and fatal), and for nonfatal strokes the scenarios described motor, language, and cognitive deficits. Patients reported values for each of the 10 stroke scenarios using a rank-and-scale method over a 100-point range, with 100 representing perfect health and 0 corresponding to the worst possible health state. One hundred seventeen of 209 consecutive patients at risk for stroke participated in this study. Severe strokes were uniformly rated as having low preference weights (mean +/- SD [median]: 3 +/- 4 [1] for disabling hemiplegia, 8 +/- 9 [5] for confusion, and 15 +/- 14 [10] for global aphasia), and severe motor impairment (a disabling hemiplegia) was rated as significantly worse than death. Even mild deficits resulted in substantial loss to patients (54 +/- 21 [55] for dysarthria and 53 +/- 21 [50] for mild anomia). Strokes may result in a wide variety of post-stroke consequences for patients. Severe strokes may be viewed by patients as tantamount to or worse than death. Even mild strokes may cause significant declines in patient preferences for health states. These data are useful in interpreting studies that report stroke and death, in designing new studies that measure stroke in at-risk populations, and in helping patients reach treatment decisions about therapies designed to prevent strokes.},

The association of traumatic brain injury mortality with the depth or duration of out-of-hospital hypotension is unknown. We evaluated the relationship between the depth and duration of out-of-hospital hypotension and mortality in major traumatic brain injury. METHODS: We evaluated adults and older children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury in the preimplementation cohort of Arizona's statewide Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care study. We used logistic regression to determine the association between the depth-duration dose of hypotension (depth of systolic blood pressure {$<$}90 mm Hg integrated over duration [minutes] of hypotension) and odds of inhospital death, controlling for significant confounders. RESULTS: There were 7,521 traumatic brain injury cases included (70.6\% male patients; median age 40 years [interquartile range 24 to 58]). Mortality was 7.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 7.2\% to 8.5\%) among the 6,982 patients without hypotension (systolic blood pressure {$\geq$}90 mm Hg) and 33.4\% (95\% CI 29.4\% to 37.6\%) among the 539 hypotensive patients (systolic blood pressure {$<$}90 mm Hg). Mortality was higher with increased hypotension dose: 0.01 to 14.99 mm Hg-minutes 16.3\%; 15 to 49.99 mm Hg-minutes 28.1\%; 50 to 141.99 mm Hg-minutes 38.8\%; and greater than or equal to 142 mm Hg-minutes 50.4\%. Log2 (the logarithm in base 2) of hypotension dose was associated with traumatic brain injury mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.19 [95\% CI 1.14 to 1.25] per 2-fold increase of dose). CONCLUSION: In this study, the depth and duration of out-of-hospital hypotension were associated with increased traumatic brain injury mortality. Assessments linking out-of-hospital blood pressure with traumatic brain injury outcomes should consider both depth and duration of hypotension.},

In patients with major traumatic brain injury, we evaluate the associations between mortality and out-of-hospital hypotension and hypoxia separately and in combination. Methods All moderate or severe traumatic brain injury cases in the preimplementation cohort of the Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care study (a statewide, before/after, controlled study of the effect of implementing the out-of-hospital traumatic brain injury treatment guidelines) from January 1, 2007, to March 31, 2014, were evaluated (exclusions: {$<$}10 years, out-of-hospital oxygen saturation {$\leq$}10\%, and out-of-hospital systolic blood pressure {$<$}40 or {$>$}200 mm Hg). The relationship between mortality and hypotension (systolic blood pressure {$<$}90 mm Hg) or hypoxia (saturation {$<$}90\%) was assessed with multivariable logistic regression, controlling for Injury Severity Score, head region severity, injury type (blunt versus penetrating), age, sex, race, ethnicity, payer, interhospital transfer, and trauma center. Results Among the 13,151 patients who met inclusion criteria (median age 45 years; 68.6\% men), 11,545 (87.8\%) had neither hypotension nor hypoxia, 604 (4.6\%) had hypotension only, 790 (6.0\%) had hypoxia only, and 212 (1.6\%) had both hypotension and hypoxia. Mortality for the 4 study cohorts was 5.6\%, 20.7\%, 28.1\%, and 43.9\%, respectively. The crude and adjusted odds ratios for death within the cohorts, using the patients with neither hypotension nor hypoxia as the reference, were 4.4 and 2.5, 6.6 and 3.0, and 13.2 and 6.1, respectively. Evaluation for an interaction between hypotension and hypoxia revealed that the effects were additive on the log odds of death. Conclusion In this statewide analysis of major traumatic brain injury, combined out-of-hospital hypotension and hypoxia were associated with significantly increased mortality. This effect on survival persisted even after controlling for multiple potential confounders. In fact, the adjusted odds of death for patients with both hypotension and hypoxia were more than 2 times greater than for those with either hypotension or hypoxia alone. These findings seem supportive of the emphasis on aggressive prevention and treatment of hypotension and hypoxia reflected in the current emergency medical services traumatic brain injury treatment guidelines but clearly reveal the need for further study to determine their influence on outcome.},

  abstract = {Background Recent studies suggest that balanced fluids improve inpatient outcomes compared to normal saline. The objective of this study was to obtain insights into clinicians' knowledge, attitudes and perceived prescribing practices concerning IV isotonic fluids and to analyze perceived prescribing in the context of actual prescribing. Methods This study, conducted at a single center (Medical University of South Carolina), included 1) a cross-sectional survey of physicians and advanced practice providers (APPs) (7/2019-8/2019) and 2) review electronic health record (EHR) claims data (2/2018-1/2019) to quantify the prescribing patterns of isotonic fluids. Results Clinicians perceived ordering equivalent amounts of normal saline and balanced fluids although normal saline ordering predominated (59.7\%). There was significant variation in perceived and actual ordering across specialties, with internal medicine/subspecialty and emergency medicine clinicians reporting preferential use of normal saline and surgical/subspecialty and anesthesia clinicians reporting preferential use of balanced fluids (p {$<$} 0.0001). Clinicians who self-reported providing care in an intensive care unit (ICU) reported more frequent use of balanced fluids than non-ICU clinicians (p~=~0.03). Actual prescribing data mirrored these differences. Clinicians' self-reported use of continuous infusions (p~=~0.0006) and beliefs regarding the volume of fluid required to cause harm (p~=~0.003) were also associated with self-reported differences in fluid prescribing. Clinician experience, most clinical considerations (e.g., indications, contraindications, barriers to using a specific fluid), and fluid cost were not associated with differential prescribing. Conclusions Persistent normal saline utilization is associated with certain specialties, care locations, and the rate and volume of fluid administered, but not with other clinical considerations or cost. These findings can guide interventions to improve evidence-based fluid prescribing.},

  abstract = {Besides the established spot sign (SS) in computed tomography angiography (CTA), there is growing evidence that different imaging markers in noncontrast CT offer great value for outcome prediction in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, it is unclear how the concurrent presence of each sign independently contributes to the predictive power of poor outcome. We, therefore, aimed to clarify the predictive value of 5 recently published noncontrast CT parameters (blend sign, black hole sign, island sign, hematoma heterogeneity, and hypodensities) and the established SS in 1 consecutive series of patients with ICH. Retrospective study of patients with ICH at 2 German tertiary stroke centers; inclusion criteria were (1) spontaneous ICH and (2) noncontrast CT and CTA performed on admission within 6 hours after onset of symptoms. We defined a binary outcome (good outcome [modified Rankin Scale score of {$\leq$}3] versus poor outcome [modified Rankin Scale score of {$>$}3]) at discharge. The predictive value of each sign was assessed in univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. Of 201 patients with spontaneous ICH, 28 (13.9\%) presented with black hole sign, 38 (18.9\%) with blend sign, 120 (59.7\%) with hypodensities, 97 (48.3\%) with heterogeneous densities, 53 with island sign (26.4\%), and 45 (22.4\%) with SS. In univariable logistic regression, higher hematoma volume (P{$<$}0.001), intraventricular hemorrhage (P=0.002), and the presence of black hole sign/blend sign/hypodensities/island sign/SS/heterogeneous density (all P{$<$}0.001) on admission CT were associated with poor outcome. Multivariable analysis confirmed intraventricular hemorrhage (odds ratio, 2.20; P=0.025), higher hematoma volume (odds ratio, 1.02 per mL; P{$<$}0.019), the presence of hypodensities (odds ratio, 2.47; P=0.018), and SS (odds ratio, 12.22; P{$<$}0.001) as independent predictors of poor outcome. This study demonstrates the degree of interaction between 5 recent noncontrast CT imaging markers and SS and their individual contribution for outcome prediction in patients with ICH. Of the CT variables indicating poor outcome SS on CTA and hypodensities were the most reliable outcome predictors.}

  abstract = {Background and Purpose- This study determined the influence of concomitant antiplatelet therapy (APT) on hematoma characteristics and outcome in primary spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), vitamin K antagonist (VKA)- and non-VKA oral anticoagulant-associated ICH. Methods- Data of retrospective cohort studies and a prospective single-center study were pooled. Functional outcome, mortality, and radiological characteristics were defined as primary and secondary outcomes. Propensity score matching and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between single or dual APT and hematoma volume. Results- A total of 3580 patients with ICH were screened, of whom 3545 with information on APT were analyzed. Three hundred forty-six (32.4\%) patients in primary spontaneous ICH, 260 (11.4\%) in VKA-ICH, and 30 (16.0\%) in non-VKA oral anticoagulant-associated ICH were on APT, and these patients had more severe comorbidities. After propensity score matching VKA-ICH patients on APT presented with less favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-3; APT, 48/202 [23.8\%] versus no APT, 187/587 [31.9\%]; P=0.030) and higher mortality (APT, 103/202 [51.0\%] versus no APT, 237/587 [40.4\%]; P=0.009), whereas no significant differences were present in primary spontaneous ICH and non-VKA oral anticoagulant-associated ICH. In VKA-ICH, hematoma volume was significantly larger in patients with APT (21.9 [7.4-61.4] versus 15.7 [5.7-44.5] mL; P=0.005). Multivariable regression analysis revealed an association of APT and larger ICH volumes (odds ratio, 1.80 [1.20-2.70]; P=0.005), which was more pronounced in dual APT and supratherapeutically anticoagulated patients. Conclusions- APT does not affect ICH characteristics and outcome in primary spontaneous ICH patients; however, it is associated with larger ICH volume and worse functional outcome in VKA-ICH, presumably by additive antihemostatic effects. Combination of anticoagulation and APT should, therefore, be diligently evaluated and restricted to the shortest possible time frame.},

PARTICIPANTS: Seriously ill patients (n = 340), recently bereaved family (n = 332), physicians (n = 361), and other care providers (nurses, social workers, chaplains, and hospice volunteers; n = 429). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Importance of 44 attributes of quality at the end of life (5-point scale) and rankings of 9 major attributes, compared in the 4 groups. RESULTS: Twenty-six items consistently were rated as being important ({$>$}70\% responding that item is important) across all 4 groups, including pain and symptom management, preparation for death, achieving a sense of completion, decisions about treatment preferences, and being treated as a "whole person." Eight items received strong importance ratings from patients but less from physicians (P{$<$}.001), including being mentally aware, having funeral arrangements planned, not being a burden, helping others, and coming to peace with God. Ten items had broad variation within as well as among the 4 groups, including decisions about life-sustaining treatments, dying at home, and talking about the meaning of death. Participants ranked freedom from pain most important and dying at home least important among 9 major attributes. CONCLUSIONS: Although pain and symptom management, communication with one's physician, preparation for death, and the opportunity to achieve a sense of completion are important to most, other factors important to quality at the end of life differ by role and by individual. Efforts to evaluate and improve patients' and families' experiences at the end of life must account for diverse perceptions of quality. JAMA. 2000;284:2476-2482.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models provide risk estimates for the presence of disease (diagnosis) or an event in the future course of disease (prognosis) for individual patients. Although publications that present and evaluate such models are becoming more frequent, the methodology is often suboptimal. We propose that seven steps should be considered in developing prediction models: (i) consideration of the research question and initial data inspection; (ii) coding of predictors; (iii) model specification; (iv) model estimation; (v) evaluation of model performance; (vi) internal validation; and (vii) model presentation. The validity of a prediction model is ideally assessed in fully independent data, where we propose four key measures to evaluate model performance: calibration-in-the-large, or the model intercept (A); calibration slope (B); discrimination, with a concordance statistic (C); and clinical usefulness, with decision-curve analysis (D). As an application, we develop and validate prediction models for 30-day mortality in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. This illustrates the usefulness of the proposed framework to strengthen the methodological rigour and quality for prediction models in cardiovascular research.}

We studied the agreement and validity of predictions for individual patients.Study Design and SettingWe compared predictions from five predictive logistic regression models for short-term mortality after AMI. Three models were developed previously, and two models were developed in the GUSTO-I data, where all five models were applied (n =40,830, 7.0\% 30-day mortality). Agreement was studied with weighted kappa statistics of categorized predictions. Validity was assessed by comparing observed frequencies with predictions (indicating calibration) and by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), indicating discriminative ability.ResultsThe predictions from the five models varied considerably for individual patients, with low agreement between most (kappa {$<$}0.6). Risk predictions from the three previously developed models were on average too high, which could be corrected by re-calibration of the model intercept. The AUC ranged from 0.76\textendash 0.78 and increased to 0.78\textendash 0.79 with re-estimated regression coefficients that were optimal for the GUSTO-I patients. The two more detailed GUSTO-I based models performed better (AUC {$\sim$}0.82).ConclusionModels with different predictors may have a similar validity while the agreement between predictions for individual patients is poor. The main concerns in the applicability of predictive models for AMI should relate to the selected predictors and average calibration.}

  abstract = {Delirium is the most common manifestation of brain dysfunction in critically ill patients. In the intensive care unit (ICU), duration of delirium is independently predictive of excess death, length of stay, cost of care, and acquired dementia. There are numerous neurotransmitter/functional and/or injury-causing hypotheses rather than a unifying mechanism for delirium. Without using a validated delirium instrument, delirium can be misdiagnosed (under, but also overdiagnosed and trivialized), supporting the recommendation to use a monitoring instrument routinely. The best-validated ICU bedside instruments are CAM-ICU and ICDSC, both of which also detect subsyndromal delirium. Both tools have some inherent limitations in the neurologically injured patients, yet still provide valuable information about delirium once the sequelae of the primary injury settle into a new post-injury baseline. Now it is known that antipsychotics and other psychoactive medications do not reliably improve brain function in critically ill delirious patients. ICU teams should systematically screen for predisposing and precipitating factors. These include exacerbations of cardiac/respiratory failure or sepsis, metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia, dysnatremia, uremia and ammonemia) receipt of psychoactive medications, and sensory deprivation through prolonged immobilization, uncorrected vision and hearing deficits, poor sleep hygiene, and isolation from loved ones so common during COVID19 pandemic. The ABCDEF (A2F) bundle is a means to facilitate implementation of the 2018 Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU (PADIS) Guidelines. In over 25,000 patients across nearly 100 institutions, the A2F bundle has been shown in a dose\textendash response fashion (i.e., greater bundle compliance) to yield improved survival, length of stay, coma and delirium duration, cost, and less ICU bounce-backs and discharge to nursing homes.},

  abstract = {Evidence-based medicine (EBM) calls on clinicians to incorporate the `best available evidence' into clinical decision-making. For decisions regarding treatment, the best evidence is that which determines the causal effect of treatments on the clinical outcomes of interest. Unfortunately, research often provides evidence where associations are not due to cause-and-effect, but rather due to non-causal reasons. These non-causal associations may provide valid evidence for diagnosis or prognosis, but biased evidence for treatment effects. Causal inference aims to determine when we can infer that associations are or are not due to causal effects. Since recommending treatments that do not have beneficial causal effects will not improve health, causal inference can advance the practice of EBM. The purpose of this article is to familiarise clinicians with some of the concepts and terminology that are being used in the field of causal inference, including graphical diagrams known as `causal directed acyclic graphs'. In order to demonstrate some of the links between causal inference methods and clinical treatment decisionmaking, we use a clinical vignette of assessing treatments to lower cardiovascular risk. As the field of causal inference advances, clinicians familiar with the methods and terminology will be able to improve their adherence to the principles of EBM by distinguishing causal effects of treatment from results due to non-causal associations that may be a source of bias.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frustrated with the onslaught of articles reporting fascination with results that appear paradoxical but are merely due to selection bias, we studied the apparent effect of obesity on diabetes risk in youth who had a test for diabetes. We hypothesised that obese subjects would have lower rates of diabetes than non-obese subjects due to selection bias, and consequently, obesity would appear to lower the risk of diabetes. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of children (4-9 years), pre-teens (10-12 years) and teenagers (13-19 years). Participation was restricted to those who had a test of haemoglobin A1C along with measured height and weight. Body mass index percentile via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention age and sex standards was calculated and categorised. The main outcome was A1C\%, subsequently categorised at the level for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus ({$\geq$}6.5\%). RESULTS: The sample consisted of 134 (2\%) underweight, 1718 (30\%) healthy weight, 660 (12\%) overweight and 3190 (56\%) obese individuals. 16\% (n=936) had an A1C{$\geq$}6.5\%. Overall, healthy weight children had 8.2 times the risk of A1C{$\geq$}6.5\% (95\% CI 5.3 to 12.7) compared with those in the obese category. The relative risk was 13 in pre-teens (95\%\,CI 8.5 to 20.0) and 3.9 in teenagers (95\%\,CI 3.3\,to 4.7). CONCLUSIONS: Healthy weight was associated with a 4-13 times higher relative risk of diabetes mellitus compared with being obese. While apparently shocking, the study's fatal flaw (selection bias) explains the 'paradoxical' finding. Ignoring selection bias can delay advances in medical science.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter retrospective medical record review analyzed clinical and EEG data from patients 18 years or older with a clinical indication for cEEG and an EEG duration of 12 hours or longer who were receiving consecutive cEEG at 6 centers from January 2012 to January 2019. 2HELPS2B was evaluated with the validation cohort using the mean calibration error (CAL), a measure of the difference between prediction and actual results. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine the duration of EEG monitoring to achieve a seizure risk of less than 5\% based on the 2HELPS2B score calculated on first- hour (screening) EEG. Participants undergoing elective epilepsy monitoring and those who had experienced cardiac arrest were excluded. No participants who met the inclusion criteria were excluded. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was a CAL error of less than 5\% in the validation cohort. RESULTS The study included 2111 participants (median age, 51 years; 1113 men [52.7\%]; median EEG duration, 48 hours) and the primary outcome was met with a validation cohort CAL error of 4.0\% compared with a CAL of 2.7\% in the foundational cohort (P = .13). For the 2HELPS2B score calculated on only the first hour of EEG in those without seizures during that hour, the CAL error remained at less than 5.0\% at 4.2\% and allowed for stratifying patients into low(2HELPS2B = 0; {$<$}5\% risk of seizures), medium- (2HELPS2B = 1; 12\% risk of seizures), and high-risk (2HELPS2B, Ն2; risk of seizures, {$>$}25\%) groups. Each of the categories had an associated minimum recommended duration of EEG monitoring to achieve at least a less than 5\% risk of seizures, a 2HELPS2B score of 0 at 1-hour screening EEG, a 2HELPS2B score of 1 at 12 hours, and a 2HELPS2B score of 2 or greater at 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, 2HELPS2B was validated as a clinical tool to aid in seizure detection, clinical communication, and cEEG use in hospitalized patients. In patients without prior clinical seizures, a screening 1-hour EEG that showed no epileptiform findings was an adequate screen. In patients with any highly epileptiform EEG patterns during the first hour of EEG (ie, a 2HELPS2B score of Ն2), at least 24 hours of recording is recommended.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To use seizure risk factors from EEG and clinical history to create a simple scoring system associated with the probability of seizures in patients with acute illness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used a prospective multicenter (Emory University Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Yale University Hospital) database containing clinical and electrographic variables on 5427 continuous EEG sessions from eligible patients if they had continuous EEG for clinical indications, excluding epilepsy monitoring unit admissions. We created a scoring system model to estimate seizure risk in acutely ill patients undergoing continuous EEG. The model was built using a new machine learning method (RiskSLIM) that is designed to produce accurate, risk-calibrated scoring systems with a limited number of variables and small integer weights. We validated the accuracy and risk calibration of our model using cross-validation and compared its performance with models built with state-of-the-art logistic regression methods. The database was developed by the Critical Care EEG Research Consortium and used data collected over 3 years. The EEG variables were interpreted using standardized terminology by certified reviewers. EXPOSURES All patients had more than 6 hours of uninterrupted EEG recordings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was the average risk calibration error. RESULTS There were 5427 continuous EEGs performed on 4772 participants (2868 men, 49.9\%; median age, 61 years) performed at 3 institutions, without further demographic stratification. Our final model, 2HELPS2B, had an area under the curve of 0.819 and average calibration error of 2.7\% (95\% CI, 2.0\%-3.6\%). It included 6 variables with the following point assignments: (1) brief (ictal) rhythmic discharges (B[I]RDs) (2 points); (2) presence of lateralized periodic discharges, lateralized rhythmic delta activity, or bilateral independent periodic discharges (1 point); (3) prior seizure (1 point); (4) sporadic epileptiform discharges (1 point); (5) frequency greater than 2.0 Hz for any periodic or rhythmic pattern (1 point); and (6) presence of ``plus'' features (superimposed, rhythmic, sharp, or fast activity) (1 point). The probable seizure risk of each score was 5\% for a score of 0, 12\% for a score of 1, 27\% for a score of 2, 50\% for a score of 3, 73\% for a score of 4, 88\% for a score of 5, and greater than 95\% for a score of 6 or 7. Editorial page 1395 CME Quiz at jamanetwork.com/learning CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The 2HELPS2B model is a quick accurate tool to aid clinical judgment of the risk of seizures in critically ill patients.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies project a significant rise in cases of chronic subdural haematoma over the next 20 years. Patients with this condition are frequently older and medically complex, with baseline characteristics that may increase peri-operative risk. The intra-operative period is only a small portion of a patient's total hospital stay, with a majority of patients in the United Kingdom transferred between institutions for their surgical and rehabilitative care. Definitive management remains surgical, but peri-operative challenges exist which resonate with other surgical cohorts where multidisciplinary working has become the gold standard. These include shared decision-making, medical optimisation, the management of peri-operative anticoagulation and the identification of key points of equipoise for examination in the future trials. In this narrative review, we use a stereotyped patient journey to provide context to the recent literature, highlighting where multidisciplinary expertise may be required to optimise patient care and maximise the benefits of surgical management. We discuss the triage, pre-operative optimisation, intra-operative management and immediate postoperative care of patients undergoing surgery for a chronic subdural haematoma. We also discuss where adjunctive medical management may be indicated. In so doing, we present the current and emerging evidence base for the role of an integrated peri-operative medicine team in the care of patients with a chronic subdural haematoma.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine predictors of in-hospital and long-term mortality and length of stay in patients admitted to the neurosciences critical care unit. Design: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database. Setting: Neurosciences critical care unit of a large academic tertiary care hospital. Patients: Adult patients (n \&equals; 2381) admitted to our neurosciences critical care unit from January 1997 to April 2000. Interventions: Introduction of a specialized neurocritical care team. Measurements and Main Results: Data obtained from the database included demographics, admission source, length of stay, neurosciences critical care unit and hospital disposition, admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score, and principal and secondary diagnoses. The introduction of a neurocritical care team in September 1998 was also collected, as was death at 1 yr after admission. Univariate analysis was carried out using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or chi-square test (significance, p {$<$} .05). A logistic regression model was used to create a prediction model for in-hospital and long-term mortality. A general linear model was used to determine predictors of length of stay (after log transformation). Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality included APACHE III (odds ratio, 1.07 \&lsqb;1.06\textendash 1.08\&rsqb;) and admission from another intensive care unit (odds ratio, 2.9 \&lsqb;1.4\textendash 6.2\&rsqb;). The presence of a neurocritical care team was an independent predictor of decreased mortality (odds ratio, 0.7 \&lsqb;0.5\textendash 1.0\&rsqb;, p \&equals; .044). Admission after the neurocritical care team was implemented was associated with reduced length of stay in both the neurosciences critical care unit (4.2 {$\pm$} 4.0 vs. 3.7 {$\pm$} 3.4, p {$<$} .001) and the hospital (9.9 {$\pm$} 8.0 vs. 8.4 {$\pm$} 6.9, p {$<$} .0001). There was no difference in readmission rates to the intensive care unit or discharge disposition to home before and after the neurocritical care team was established. The availability of the neurocritical care team was not associated with significant changes in long-term mortality. Factors independently associated with long-term mortality included female gender, admission from another intensive care unit, APACHE III score, and being moderately disabled before admission. Conclusion: Introduction of a neurocritical care team, including a full-time neurointensivist who coordinated care, was associated with significantly reduced in-hospital mortality and length of stay without changes in readmission rates or long-term mortality.}

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We used two prospectively compiled Swedish national quality registers, the National Quality Sepsis Regis-try and the Swedish Intensive Care Registry to identify a nationwide cohort of 2720 adults admitted to an ICU within 24 h of arrival to any of 32 EDs, with a diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock between 2008 and 2015. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Patients were 44.5\% female. In the EMS, a higher fraction of men had all vital signs recorded\textemdash 54.4 vs 49.9\% (p\,=\,0.02) and received IV fluids and oxygen\textemdash 40.0 vs 34.8\% (p\,=\,0.02). In the ED, men had completed 1-h sepsis bun-dles in 41.5\% of cases compared to 30.0\% in women (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and shorter time to antibiotics\textemdash 65 (IQR 30\textendash 136) vs 87 min (IQR 39\textendash 172) (p\,=\,0.0001). There was no significant difference between men and women regarding ICU nurs-ing workload, mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay. In severity-adjusted multivariable analysis, OR for women achieving a completed sepsis bundle, compared to men was 0.64 (CI 0.51\textendash 0.81). Thirty-day mortality was 25.0\% for women and 23.1\% for men (p\,=\,0.24). Adjusted OR for female death was 1.28 (CI 1.00\textendash 1.64), but the increased mortal-ity was not mediated by differential bundle completion. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Women and men with severe sepsis or septic shock received differential care in the ED, but this did not explain higher odds of death in women.},

  abstract = {Although the randomised controlled trial is the "gold standard" for studying the efficacy and safety of medical treatments, it is not necessarily free from bias. When patients do not follow the protocol for their assigned treatment, the resultant "treatment contamination" can produce misleading findings. The methods used historically to deal with this problem, the "as treated" and "per protocol" analysis techniques, are flawed and inaccurate. Intention to treat analysis is the solution most often used to analyse randomised controlled trials, but this approach ignores this issue of treatment contamination. Intention to treat analysis estimates the effect of recommending a treatment to study participants, not the effect of the treatment on those study participants who actually received it. In this article, we describe a simple yet rarely used analytical technique, the "contamination adjusted intention to treat analysis," which complements the intention to treat approach by producing a better estimate of the benefits and harms of receiving a treatment. This method uses the statistical technique of instrumental variable analysis to address contamination. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the current methods of addressing treatment contamination and the contamination adjusted intention to treat technique, provide examples of effective uses, and discuss how using estimates generated by contamination adjusted intention to treat analysis can improve clinical decision making and patient care.},

This structured approach serves as a visual aid in the scientific discussion by making underlying relations explicit. This article explains the basic concepts of DAGs and provides examples in the field of nephrology with and without presence of confounding. Ultimately, these examples will show that DAGs can be preferable to the traditional methods to identify sources of confounding, especially in complex research questions.},

  abstract = {Delirium is one of the most commonly occurring postoperative complications in older adults. It occurs due to the vulnerability of cerebral functioning to pathophysiological stressors. Identification of those at increased risk of developing delirium early in the surgical pathway provides an opportunity for modification of predisposing and precipitating risk factors and effective shared decision-making. No single delirium prediction tool is used widely in surgical settings. Multi-component interventions to prevent delirium involve structured risk factor modification supported by geriatrician input; these are clinically efficacious and cost effective. Barriers to the widespread implementation of such complex interventions exist, resulting in an `implementation gap'. There is a lack of evidence for pharmacological prophylaxis for the prevention of delirium. Current evidence suggests that avoidance of peri-operative benzodiazepines, careful titration of anaesthetic depth guided by processed electroencephalogram monitoring and treatment of pain are the most effective strategies to minimise the risk of delirium. Addressing postoperative delirium requires a collaborative, whole pathway approach, beginning with the early identification of those patients who are at risk. The research agenda should continue to examine the potential for pharmacological prophylaxis to prevent delirium while also addressing how successful models of delirium prevention can be translated from one setting to another, underpinned by implementation science methodology.},

Demographics, clinical measures, and outcomes were compared between ICH patients with positive methamphetamine toxicology tests vs those with negative methamphetamine toxicology tests. Results Methamphetamine-positive ICH patients were younger than methamphetamine-negative ICH patients (52 vs 67 years, p {$<$} 0.001). Patients with methamphetamine-positive ICH had higher diastolic blood pressure (115 vs 101, p = 0.003), higher mean arterial pressure (144 vs 129, p = 0.01), longer lengths of hospital (18 vs 8 days, p {$<$} 0.001) and intensive care unit (ICU) stay (10 vs 5 days, p {$<$} 0.001), required more days of IV antihypertensive medications (5 vs 3 days, p = 0.02), and had more subcortical hemorrhages (63\% vs 46\%, p = 0.05). The methamphetaminepositive group had better premorbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores (p {$<$} 0.001) and a greater change in functional ability as measured by mRS at the time of hospital discharge (p = 0.001). In multivariate analyses, methamphetamine use predicted both hospital length of stay (risk ratio [RR] 1.54, confidence interval [CI] 1.39\textendash 1.70, p {$<$} 0.001) and ICU length of stay (RR 1.36, CI 1.18\textendash 1.56, p {$<$} 0.001), but did not predict poor outcome (mRS 4\textendash 6). Conclusions Methamphetamine use is associated with earlier age at onset of ICH, longer hospital stays, and greater change in functional ability, but did not predict outcome.},

However, specific data for ICH are lacking. Here, we aimed to investigate the association between ICP, mortality and functional outcome following severe ICH. Methods We analyzed consecutive comatose patients with ICH in whom ICP monitoring was applied. Outcome at 3months was assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS). Multivariate logistic regression including pre-defined predictors was used in order to identify the effects of ICP on outcome. Results 121 patients with ICH and ICP monitoring were analyzed. Mean ICP (OR 1.2, CI 1.08\textendash 1.45, p=0.003), ICP variability (OR 1.3, CI 1.03\textendash 1.73, p=0.03) and relative frequency of ICP values {$>$}20mmHg (OR 1.1, CI 1.02\textendash{} 1.15, p=0.008) were independently associated with mortality at 3months. Relative frequency of ICP values {$>$}20mmHg (OR 1.1, CI 1.001\textendash 1.3, p=0.04) was associated also with poor functional outcome at 3months. Conclusions Our data suggest that in the context of other predictors as age, admission clinical status, hemorrhage volume and intraventricular hemorrhage, average ICP, ICP variability and the frequency of ICP values {$>$}20mmHg are independently associated with mortality and poor outcome after ICH. Further studies and prospective validations of ICP thresholds for ICH patients are highly warranted.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify whether factors associated with withholding extubation in the ICU also predict the risk of extubation failure. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Eight medical-surgical ICUs in Toronto. PATIENTS: Adult patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, with a first successful spontaneous breathing trial within 28 days of initial ICU admission. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary end point had three mutually exclusive levels, including: 1) withholding extubation after a successful spontaneous breathing trial, 2) extubation failure within 48 hours, and 3) successful extubation. Among 9,910 patients, 38\% of patients were not extubated within 24 hours of their first successful spontaneous breathing trial. A total of 12.9\% of patients who were promptly extubated failed within the next 48 hours. Several discrepancies were evident in the association of factors with risk of withholding extubation and extubation failure. Specifically, both age and female sex were associated with withholding extubation (odds ratio, 1.07; 95\% CI, 1.03\textendash 1.11; and odds ratio, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.02\textendash 1.26, respectively) but not a higher risk of failed extubation (odds ratio, 0.99; 95\% CI, 0.93\textendash 1.05; and odds ratio, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.77\textendash 1.11, respectively). Conversely, both acute cardiovascular conditions and intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure were associated with a higher risk of failed extubation (odds ratio, 1.32; 95\% CI, 1.06\textendash 1.66; and odds ratio, 1.46; 95\% CI, 1.16\textendash 1.82, respectively) but not a higher odds of a withheld extubation attempt (odds ratio, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.68\textendash 0.91; and odds ratio, 1.07; 95\% CI, 0.93\textendash 1.23, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Several factors showed discordance between the decision to withhold extubation and the risk of extubation failure. This discordance may lead to longer duration of mechanical ventilation or higher reintubation rates. Improving the decision-making behind extubation may help to reduce both exposure to invasive mechanical ventilation and extubation failure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with dementia due to neurodegenerative disease can have dementia-related psychosis. The effects of the oral 5-HT2A inverse agonist and antagonist pimavanserin on psychosis related to various causes of dementia are not clear. METHODS We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled discontinuation trial involving patients with psychosis related to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, or vascular dementia. Patients received open-label pimavanserin for 12 weeks. Those who had a reduction from baseline of at least 30\% in the score on the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms\textendash Hallucinations and Delusions (SAPS\textendash H+D, with higher scores indicating greater psychosis) and a Clinical Global Impression\textendash Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) at weeks 8 and 12 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to continue receiving pimavanserin or to receive placebo for up to 26 weeks. The primary end point, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was a relapse of psychosis as defined by any of the following: an increase of at least 30\% in the SAPS\textendash H+D score and a CGI-I score of 6 (much worse) or 7 (very much worse), hospitalization for dementia-related psychosis, stopping of the trial regimen or withdrawal from the trial for lack of efficacy, or use of antipsychotic agents for dementia-related psychosis. RESULTS Of the 392 patients in the open-label phase, 41 were withdrawn for administrative reasons because the trial was stopped for efficacy; of the remaining 351 patients, 217 (61.8\%) had a sustained response, of whom 105 were assigned to receive pimavanserin and 112 to receive placebo. A relapse occurred in 12 of 95 patients (13\%) in the pimavanserin group and in 28 of 99 (28\%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95\% confidence interval, 0.17 to 0.73; P\,=\,0.005). During the double-blind phase, adverse events occurred in 43 of 105 patients (41.0\%) in the pimavanserin group and in 41 of 112 (36.6\%) in the placebo group. Headache, constipation, urinary tract infection, and asymptomatic QT prolongation occurred with pimavanserin. CONCLUSIONS In a trial that was stopped early for efficacy, patients with dementia-related psychosis who had a response to pimavanserin had a lower risk of relapse with continuation of the drug than with discontinuation. Longer and larger trials are required to determine the effects of pimavanserin in dementia-related psychosis. (Funded by Acadia Pharmaceuticals; HARMONY ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03325556.)},

This study evaluated the feasibility and safety of CA-guided CPP management in TBI patients requiring intracranial pressure monitoring and therapy (TBIicp patients). The CPPopt Guided Therapy: Assessment of Target Effectiveness (COGiTATE) parallel two-arm feasibility trial took place in four tertiary centers. TBIicp patients were randomized to either the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guideline CPP target range (control group) or to the individualized CA-guided CPP targets (intervention group). CPP targets were guided by six times daily software-based alerts for up to 5 days. The primary feasibility end-point was the percentage of time with CPP concordant (\textendash 5 mm Hg) with the set CPP targets. The main secondary safety endpoint was an increase in therapeutic intensity level (TIL) between the control and intervention group. Twenty-eight patients were randomized to the control and 32 patients to the intervention group. CPP in the intervention group was in the target range for 46.5\% (interquartile range, 41.2\textendash 58) of the monitored time, significantly higher than the feasibility target specified in the published protocol (36\%; p {$<$} 0.001). There were no significant differences between groups for TIL or for other safety end-points. Conclusively, targeting an individual and dynamic CA-guided CPP is feasible and safe in TBIicp patients. This encourages a prospective trial powered for clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {BackgroundClinicians? decision thresholds for initiating antibiotics in patients with suspected sepsis have not been quantified. We aimed to define an average threshold of infection likelihood at which clinicians initiate antibiotics when treating a patient with suspected infection and to evaluate the influence of severity of illness and clinician-related factors on the threshold.DesignThis was a prospective survey of 153 clinicians responding to 8 clinical vignettes constructed from real-world data from 3 health care systems in the United States. We treated each hour in the vignette as a decision to treat or not treat with antibiotics and assigned an infection probability to each hour using a previously developed infection prediction model. We then estimated decision thresholds using regression models based on the timing of antibiotic initiation. We compared thresholds across categories of severity of illness and clinician-related factors.ResultsOverall, the treatment threshold occurred at a 69\% probability of infection, but the threshold varied significantly across severity of illness categories?when patients had high severity of illness, the treatment threshold occurred at a 55\% probability of infection; when patients had intermediate severity, the threshold for antibiotic initiation occurred at an infection probability of 69\%, and the threshold was 84\% when patients had low severity of illness (P {$<$} 0.001 for group differences). Thresholds differed significantly across specialty, highest among infectious disease and lowest among emergency medicine clinicians and across years of experience, decreasing with increasing years of experience.ConclusionsThe threshold infection probability above which physicians choose to initiate antibiotics in suspected sepsis depends on illness severity as well as clinician factors.ImplicationsIncorporating these context-dependent thresholds into discriminating and well-calibrated models will inform the development of future sepsis clinical decision support systems. Clinician-related differences in treatment thresholds suggests potential unwarranted variation and opportunities for performance improvement.HighlightsDecision making about antibiotic initiation in suspected sepsis occurs under uncertainty, and little is known about clinicians? thresholds for treatment.In this prospective study, 153 clinicians from 3 health care systems reviewed 8 real-world clinical vignettes representing patients with sepsis and indicated the time that they would initiate antibiotics.Using a model-based approach, we estimated decision thresholds and found that thresholds differed significantly across illness severity categories and by clinician specialty and years of experience.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the changes in ventilator management over time in patients with neurologic disease at ICU admission and to estimate factors associated with 28-day hospital mortality. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of three prospective, observational, multicenter studies. SETTING: Cohort studies conducted in 2004, 2010, and 2016. PATIENTS: Adult patients who received mechanical ventilation for more than 12 hours. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the 20,929 patients enrolled, we included 4,152 (20\%) mechanically ventilated patients due to different neurologic diseases. Hemorrhagic stroke and brain trauma were the most common pathologies associated with the need for mechanical ventilation. Although volume-cycled ventilation remained the preferred ventilation mode, there was a significant (p {$<$} 0.001) increment in the use of pressure support ventilation. The proportion of patients receiving a protective lung ventilation strategy was increased over time: 47\% in 2004, 63\% in 2010, and 65\% in 2016 (p {$<$} 0.001), as well as the duration of protective ventilation strategies: 406 days per 1,000 mechanical ventilation days in 2004, 523 days per 1,000 mechanical ventilation days in 2010, and 585 days per 1,000 mechanical ventilation days in 2016 (p {$<$} 0.001). There were no differences in the length of stay in the ICU, mortality in the ICU, and mortality in hospital from 2004 to 2016. Independent risk factors for 28-day mortality were age greater than 75 years, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II greater than 50, the occurrence of organ dysfunction within first 48 hours after brain injury, and specific neurologic diseases such as hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, and brain trauma. CONCLUSIONS: More lung-protective ventilatory strategies have been implemented over years in neurologic patients with no effect on pulmonary complications or on survival. We found several prognostic factors on mortality such as advanced age, the severity of the disease, organ dysfunctions, and the etiology of neurologic disease.},

  abstract = {Treatment of respiratory failure has improved dramatically since the polio epidemic in the 1950s with the use of invasive techniques for respiratory support: mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal respiratory support. However, respiratory support is only a supportive therapy, designed to ``buy time'' while the disease causing respiratory failure abates. It ensures viable gas exchange and prevents cardiorespiratory collapse in the context of excessive loads. Because the use of invasive modalities of respiratory support is also associated with substantial harm, it remains the responsibility of the clinician to minimize such hazards. Direct iatrogenic consequences of mechanical ventilation include the risk to the lung (ventilator-induced lung injury) and the diaphragm (ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction and other forms of myotrauma). Adverse consequences on hemodynamics can also be significant. Indirect consequences (e.g., immobilization, sleep disruption) can have devastating long-term effects. Increasing awareness and understanding of these mechanisms of injury has led to a change in the philosophy of care with a shift from aiming to normalize gases toward minimizing harm. Lung (and more recently also diaphragm) protective ventilation strategies include the use of extracorporeal respiratory support when the risk of ventilation becomes excessive. This review provides an overview of the historical background of respiratory support, pathophysiology of respiratory failure and rationale for respiratory support, iatrogenic consequences from mechanical ventilation, specifics of the implementation of mechanical ventilation, and role of extracorporeal respiratory support. It highlights the need for appropriate monitoring to estimate risks and to individualize ventilation and sedation to provide safe respiratory support to each patient.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines\textemdash mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech)\textemdash and COVID-19 hospitalization, and, among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the association with progression to critical disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A US 21-site case-control analysis of 4513 adults hospitalized between March 11 and August 15, 2021, with 28-day outcome data on death and mechanical ventilation available for patients enrolled through July 14, 2021. Date of final follow-up was August 8, 2021. EXPOSURES COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Associations were evaluated between prior vaccination and (1) hospitalization for COVID-19, in which case patients were those hospitalized for COVID-19 and control patients were those hospitalized for an alternative diagnosis; and (2) disease progression among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, in which cases and controls were COVID-19 patients with and without progression to death or mechanical ventilation, respectively. Associations were measured with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Among 4513 patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 45-69]; 2202 [48.8\%] women; 23.0\% non-Hispanic Black individuals, 15.9\% Hispanic individuals, and 20.1\% with an immunocompromising condition), 1983 were case patients with COVID-19 and 2530 were controls without COVID-19. Unvaccinated patients accounted for 84.2\% (1669/1983) of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Hospitalization for COVID-19 was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (cases, 15.8\%; controls, 54.8\%; adjusted OR, 0.15; 95\% CI, 0.13-0.18), including for sequenced SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (8.7\% vs 51.7\%; aOR, 0.10; 95\% CI, 0.06-0.16) and Delta variants (21.9\% vs 61.8\%; aOR, 0.14; 95\% CI, 0.10-0.21). This association was stronger for immunocompetent patients (11.2\% vs 53.5\%; aOR, 0.10; 95\% CI, 0.09-0.13) than immunocompromisedpatients(40.1\%vs58.8\%;aOR,0.49;95\%CI,0.35-0.69)(P {$<$} .001)andweaker at more than 120 days since vaccination with BNT162b2 (5.8\% vs 11.5\%; aOR, 0.36; 95\% CI, 0.270.49) than with mRNA-1273 (1.9\% vs 8.3\%; aOR, 0.15; 95\% CI, 0.09-0.23) (P {$<$} .001). Among 1197 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, death or invasive mechanical ventilation by day 28 was associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (12.0\% vs 24.7\%; aOR, 0.33; 95\% CI, 0.19-0.58). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was significantly less likely among patients with COVID-19 hospitalization and disease progression to death or mechanical ventilation. These findings are consistent with risk reduction among vaccine breakthrough infections compared with absence of vaccination.},

  abstract = {Background Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) has been endorsed in the guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign as a key strategy to decrease mortality among patients presenting to the emergency department with septic shock. However, its effectiveness is uncertain. Methods In this trial conducted at 51 centers (mostly in Australia or New Zealand), we randomly assigned patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock to receive either EGDT or usual care. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90 days after randomization. Results Of the 1600 enrolled patients, 796 were assigned to the EGDT group and 804 to the usual-care group. Primary outcome data were available for more than 99\% of the patients. Patients in the EGDT group received a larger mean ({$\pm$}SD) volume of intravenous fluids in the first 6 hours after randomization than did those in the usualcare group (1964{$\pm$}1415 ml vs. 1713{$\pm$}1401 ml) and were more likely to receive vasopressor infusions (66.6\% vs. 57.8\%), red-cell transfusions (13.6\% vs. 7.0\%), and dobutamine (15.4\% vs. 2.6\%) (P{$<$}0.001 for all comparisons). At 90 days after randomization, 147 deaths had occurred in the EGDT group and 150 had occurred in the usual-care group, for rates of death of 18.6\% and 18.8\%, respectively (absolute risk difference with EGDT vs. usual care, -0.3 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval, -4.1 to 3.6; P\,=\,0.90). There was no significant difference in survival time, in-hospital mortality, duration of organ support, or length of hospital stay. Conclusions In critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock, EGDT did not reduce all-cause mortality at 90 days.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of 12 mg/d vs 6 mg/d of dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted between August 2020 and May 2021 at 26 hospitals in Europe and India and included 1000 adults with confirmed COVID-19 requiring at least 10 L/min of oxygen or mechanical ventilation. End of 90-day follow-up was on August 19, 2021. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to 12 mg/d of intravenous dexamethasone (n = 503) or 6 mg/d of intravenous dexamethasone (n = 497) for up to 10 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the number of days alive without life support (invasive mechanical ventilation, circulatory support, or kidney replacement therapy) at 28 days and was adjusted for stratification variables. Of the 8 prespecified secondary outcomes, 5 are included in this analysis (the number of days alive without life support at 90 days, the number of days alive out of the hospital at 90 days, mortality at 28 days and at 90 days, and Ն1 serious adverse reactions at 28 days). RESULTS Of the 1000 randomized patients, 982 were included (median age, 65 [IQR, 55-73] years; 305 [31\%] women) and primary outcome data were available for 971 (491 in the 12 mg of dexamethasone group and 480 in the 6 mg of dexamethasone group). The median number of days alive without life support was 22.0 days (IQR, 6.0-28.0 days) in the 12 mg of dexamethasone group and 20.5 days (IQR, 4.0-28.0 days) in the 6 mg of dexamethasone group (adjusted mean difference, 1.3 days [95\% CI, 0-2.6 days]; P = .07). Mortality at 28 days was 27.1\% in the 12 mg of dexamethasone group vs 32.3\% in the 6 mg of dexamethasone group (adjusted relative risk, 0.86 [99\% CI, 0.68-1.08]). Mortality at 90 days was 32.0\% in the 12 mg of dexamethasone group vs 37.7\% in the 6 mg of dexamethasone group (adjusted relative risk, 0.87 [99\% CI, 0.70-1.07]). Serious adverse reactions, including septic shock and invasive fungal infections, occurred in 11.3\% in the 12 mg of dexamethasone group vs 13.4\% in the 6 mg of dexamethasone group (adjusted relative risk, 0.83 [99\% CI, 0.54-1.29]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxemia, 12 mg/d of dexamethasone compared with 6 mg/d of dexamethasone did not result in statistically significantly more days alive without life support at 28 days. However, the trial may have been underpowered to identify a significant difference.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients who are undergoing mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) often receive a high fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) and have a high arterial oxygen tension. The conservative use of oxygen may reduce oxygen exposure, diminish lung and systemic oxidative injury, and thereby increase the number of ventilator-free days (days alive and free from mechanical ventilation). METHODS We randomly assigned 1000 adult patients who were anticipated to require mechanical ventilation beyond the day after recruitment in the ICU to receive conservative or usual oxygen therapy. In the two groups, the default lower limit for oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) was 90\%. In the conservativeoxygen group, the upper limit of the Spo2 alarm was set to sound when the level reached 97\%, and the Fio2 was decreased to 0.21 if the Spo2 was above the acceptable lower limit. In the usual-oxygen group, there were no specific measures limiting the Fio2 or the Spo2. The primary outcome was the number of ventilatorfree days from randomization until day 28. RESULTS The number of ventilator-free days did not differ significantly between the conservative-oxygen group and the usual-oxygen group, with a median duration of 21.3 days (interquartile range, 0 to 26.3) and 22.1 days (interquartile range, 0 to 26.2), respectively, for an absolute difference of -0.3 days (95\% confidence interval [CI], -2.1 to 1.6; P\,=\,0.80). The conservative-oxygen group spent more time in the ICU with an Fio2 of 0.21 than the usual-oxygen group, with a median duration of 29 hours (interquartile range, 5 to 78) and 1 hour (interquartile range, 0 to 17), respectively (absolute difference, 28 hours; 95\% CI, 22 to 34); the conservative-oxygen group spent less time with an Spo2 exceeding 96\%, with a duration of 27 hours (interquartile range, 11 to 63.5) and 49 hours (interquartile range, 22 to 112), respectively (absolute difference, 22 hours; 95\% CI, 14 to 30).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Vitamin D deficiency is a common, potentially reversible contributor to morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. The potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in acute critical illness require further study. METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of early vitamin D3 supplementation in critically ill, vitamin D\textendash deficient patients who were at high risk for death. Randomization occurred within 12 hours after the decision to admit the patient to an intensive care unit. Eligible patients received a single enteral dose of 540,000 IU of vitamin D3 or matched placebo. The primary end point was 90-day all-cause, all-location mortality. RESULTS A total of 1360 patients were found to be vitamin D\textendash deficient during point-of-care screening and underwent randomization. Of these patients, 1078 had baseline vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D level, {$<$}20 ng per milliliter [50 nmol per liter]) confirmed by subsequent testing and were included in the primary analysis population. The mean day 3 level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 46.9{$\pm$}23.2 ng per milliliter (117{$\pm$}58 nmol per liter) in the vitamin D group and 11.4{$\pm$}5.6 ng per milli\- liter (28{$\pm$}14 nmol per liter) in the placebo group (difference, 35.5 ng per milliliter; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 31.5 to 39.6). The 90-day mortality was 23.5\% in the vitamin D group (125 of 531 patients) and 20.6\% in the placebo group (109 of 528 patients) (difference, 2.9 percentage points; 95\% CI, -2.1 to 7.9; P\,=\,0.26). There were no clinically important differences between the groups with respect to secondary clinical, physiological, or safety end points. The severity of vitamin D deficiency at baseline did not affect the association between the treatment assignment and mortality. CONCLUSIONS Early administration of high-dose enteral vitamin D3 did not provide an advantage over placebo with respect to 90-day mortality or other, nonfatal outcomes among critically ill, vitamin D\textendash deficient patients.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Thrombosis and inflammation may contribute to morbidity and mortality among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). We hypothesized that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation would improve outcomes in critically ill patients with Covid-19. METHODS In an open-label, adaptive, multiplatform, randomized clinical trial, critically ill patients with severe Covid-19 were randomly assigned to a pragmatically defined regimen of either therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin or pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in accordance with local usual care. The primary outcome was organ support\textendash free days, evaluated on an ordinal scale that combined in-hospital death (assigned a value of -1) and the number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support up to day 21 among patients who survived to hospital discharge.

RESULTS The trial was stopped when the prespecified criterion for futility was met for therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. Data on the primary outcome were available for 1098 patients (534 assigned to therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and 564 assigned to usual-care thromboprophylaxis). The median value for organ support\textendash free days was 1 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) among the patients assigned to therapeuticdose anticoagulation and was 4 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) among the patients assigned to usual-care thromboprophylaxis (adjusted proportional odds ratio, 0.83; 95\% credible interval, 0.67 to 1.03; posterior probability of futility [defined as an odds ratio {$<$}1.2], 99.9\%). The percentage of patients who survived to hospital discharge was similar in the two groups (62.7\% and 64.5\%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 95\% credible interval, 0.64 to 1.11). Major bleeding occurred in 3.8\% of the patients assigned to therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and in 2.3\% of those assigned to usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Drs.

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We examined the clinical features and outcomes of 190 patients treated with ECMO within 14 days of ICU admission, using data from a multicenter cohort study of 5122 critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to 68 hospi-tals across the United States. To estimate the effect of ECMO on mortality, we emulated a target trial of ECMO receipt versus no ECMO receipt within 7 days of ICU admission among mechanically ventilated patients with severe hypox-emia \-(PaO2/FiO2\,{$<$}\,100). Patients were followed until hospital discharge, death, or a minimum of 60 days. We adjusted for confounding using a multivariable Cox model. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Among the 190 patients treated with ECMO, the median age was 49 years (IQR 41\textendash 58), 137 (72.1\%) were men, and the median P\- aO2/FiO2 prior to ECMO initiation was 72 (IQR 61\textendash 90). At 60 days, 63 patients (33.2\%) had died, 94 (49.5\%) were discharged, and 33 (17.4\%) remained hospitalized. Among the 1297 patients eligible for the target trial emulation, 45 of the 130 (34.6\%) who received ECMO died, and 553 of the 1167 (47.4\%) who did not receive ECMO died. In the primary analysis, patients who received ECMO had lower mortality than those who did not (HR 0.55; 95\% CI 0.41\textendash 0.74). Results were similar in a secondary analysis limited to patients with \-PaO2/FiO2\,{$<$}\,80 (HR 0.55; 95\% CI 0.40\textendash 0.77). Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} In select patients with severe respiratory failure from COVID-19, ECMO may reduce mortality.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Antiplatelet therapy (APT) promotes bleeding; therefore, APT might worsen outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to address the hypothesis that pre-ICH APT use is associated with mortality and poor functional outcome following ICH. METHODS: The Medline and Embase databases were searched in February 2008 using relevant key words, limited to human studies in the English language. Cohort studies of consecutive patients with ICH reporting mortality or functional outcome according to pre-ICH APT use were identified. Of 2,873 studies screened, 10 were judged to meet inclusion criteria by consensus of 2 authors. Additionally, we solicited unpublished data from all authors of cohort studies with {$>$}100 patients published within the last 10 years, and received data from 15 more studies. Univariate and multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for mortality and poor functional outcome were abstracted as available and pooled using a random effects model. RESULTS: We obtained mortality data from 25 cohorts (15 unpublished) and functional outcome data from 21 cohorts (14 unpublished). Pre-ICH APT users had increased mortality in both univariate (OR 1.41, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.21 to 1.64) and multivariable-adjusted (OR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.10 to 1.47) pooled analyses. By contrast, the pooled OR for poor functional outcome was no longer significant when using multivariable-adjusted estimates (univariate OR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.09 to 1.53; multivariable-adjusted OR 1.10, 95\% CI 0.93 to 1.29). CONCLUSIONS: In cohort studies, APT use at the time of ICH compared to no APT use was independently associated with increased mortality but not with poor functional outcome.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection across the globe triggered an unprecedented increase in research activities that resulted in an astronomical publication output of observational studies. However, most studies failed to apply fully the necessary methodological techniques that systematically deal with different biases and confounding, which not only limits their scientific merit but may result in harm through misleading information. In this article, we address a few important biases that can seriously threaten the validity of observational studies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We focus on treatment selection bias due to patients' preference on goals of care, medical futility and disability bias, survivor bias, competing risks, and the misuse of propensity score analysis. We attempt to raise awareness and to help readers assess shortcomings of observational studies of interventions in COVID-19.},

  abstract = {A diagnosis of ARDS serves as a pretext for several perilous clinical practices. Clinical trials demonstrated that tidal volume 12 ml/kg increases patient mortality, but 6 ml/kg has not proven superior to 11 ml/kg or anything in between. Present guidelines recommend 4 ml/kg, which foments severe air hunger, leading to prescription of hazardous (yet ineffective) sedatives, narcotics and paralytic agents. Inappropriate lowering of tidal volume also fosters double triggering, which promotes alveolar overdistention and lung injury. Successive panels have devoted considerable energy to developing a more precise definition of ARDS to homogenize the recruitment of patients into clinical trials. Each of three pillars of the prevailing Berlin definition is extremely flimsy and the source of confusion and unscientific practices. For doctors at the bedside, none of the revisions have enhanced patient care over that using the original 1967 description of Ashbaugh and colleagues. Bedside doctors are better advised to diagnose ARDS on the basis of pattern recognition and instead concentrate their vigilance on resolving the numerous hidden dangers that follow inevitably once a diagnosis has been made.},

  abstract = {Estimating relative causal effects (i.e., ``substitution effects'') is a common aim of nutritional research. In observational data, this is usually attempted using 1 of 2 statistical modeling approaches: the leave-one-out model and the energy partition model. Despite their widespread use, there are concerns that neither approach is well understood in practice.We aimed to explore and illustrate the theory and performance of the leave-one-out and energy partition models for estimating substitution effects in nutritional epidemiology.Monte Carlo data simulations were used to illustrate the theory and performance of both the leave-one-out model and energy partition model, by considering 3 broad types of causal effect estimands: 1) direct substitutions of the exposure with a single component, 2) inadvertent substitutions of the exposure with several components, and 3) average relative causal effects of the exposure instead of all other dietary sources. Models containing macronutrients, foods measured in calories, and foods measured in grams were all examined.The leave-one-out and energy partition models both performed equally well when the target estimand involved substituting a single exposure with a single component, provided all variables were measured in the same units. Bias occurred when the substitution involved \&gt;1 substituting component. Leave-one-out models that examined foods in mass while adjusting for total energy intake evaluated obscure estimands.Regardless of the approach, substitution models need to be constructed from clearly defined causal effect estimands. Estimands involving a single exposure and a single substituting component are typically estimated more accurately than estimands involving more complex substitutions. The practice of examining foods measured in grams or portions while adjusting for total energy intake is likely to deliver obscure relative effect estimands with unclear interpretations.},

  abstract = {Background: The findings of observational studies can be distorted by a number of factors. So-called confounders are well known, but distortion by collider bias (CB) has received little attention in medical research to date. The goal of this article is to present the principle of CB, and measures that can be taken to avoid it, by way of a few illustrative examples. Methods: The findings of a selective review of the literature on CB are explained with illustrative examples. Results: The simplest case of a collider variable is one that is caused by at least two other variables. An example of CB is the observation that, among persons with diabetes, obesity is associated with lower mortality, even though it is associated with higher mortality in the general population. The false protective association between obesity and mortality arises from the restriction of the study population to persons with diabetes. Conclusion: CB is a distortion that arises through restriction on or stratification by a collider variable, or through statistical adjustment for a collider variable in a regression model. CB can arise in many ways. The graphic representation of causal structures helps to identify potential sources of CB. It is important to distinguish confounders from colliders, as methods that serve to correct for confounding can themselves cause bias when applied to colliders. There is no generally applicable method for correcting CB. German Center for Diabetes Research, Partner D\"usseldorf, M\"unchenNeuherberg: Dr. med. Sabine Kahl Cite this as},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early hypotension after severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is associated with increased mortality and poor long-term outcomes. Current guidelines suggest the use of intravenous vasopressors, commonly norepinephrine and phenylephrine, to support blood pressure after TBI. However, guidelines do not specify vasopressor type, resulting in variation in clinical practice. We describe early vasopressor utilization patterns in critically ill patients with TBI and examine the association between utilization of norepinephrine, compared to phenylephrine, with hospital mortality after sTBI. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of US hospitals participating in the Premier Healthcare Database between 2009 and 2018. We examined adult patients ({$>$}17 years of age) with a primary diagnosis of sTBI who were treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) after injury. The primary exposure was vasopressor choice (phenylephrine versus norepinephrine) within the first 2 days of hospital admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes examined included hospital length of stay (LOS) and ICU LOS. We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis in all patients with intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor placement. Regression analysis was used to assess differences in outcomes between patients exposed to phenylephrine versus norepinephrine, with propensity matching to address selection bias due to the nonrandom allocation of treatment groups. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2018, 24,718 (37.1\%) of 66,610 sTBI patients received vasopressors within the first 2 days of hospitalization. Among these patients, 60.6\% (n = 14,991) received only phenylephrine, 10.8\% (n = 2668) received only norepinephrine, 3.5\% (n = 877) received other vasopressors, and 25.0\% (n = 6182) received multiple vasopressors. In that time period, the use of all vasopressors after sTBI increased. A moderate degree of variation in vasopressor choice was explained at the individual hospital level (23.1\%). In propensity-matched analysis, the use of norepinephrine compared to phenylephrine was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.65; CI, 1.46\textendash 1.86; P {$<$} .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Early vasopressor utilization among critically ill patients with sTBI is common, increasing over the last decade, and varies across hospitals caring for TBI patients. Compared to phenylephrine, norepinephrine was associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality in propensity-matched analysis. Given the wide variation in vasopressor utilization and possible differences in efficacy, our analysis suggests the need for randomized controlled trials to better inform vasopressor choice for patients with sTBI.\hspace{0.6em} (Anesth Analg 2022;00:00\textendash 00)},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine secular changes in initial neurological severity and short-term functional outcomes of patients with acute stroke by sex using a large population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This nationwide, hospital-based, multicenter, prospective registry cohort study used the Japan Stroke Data Bank and included patients who developed acute stroke from January 2000 through December 2019. Patients with stroke, including ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, who registered within 7 days after symptom onset were studied. Modified Rankin Scale scores were assessed at hospital discharge for all patients. EXPOSURE Time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Initial severity was assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale for ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage and by the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grading for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Outcomes were judged as favorable if the modified Rankin Scale score was 0 to 2 and unfavorable if 5 to 6. RESULTS Of 183 080 patients, 135 266 (53 800 women [39.8\%]; median [IQR] age, 74 [66-82] years) developed ischemic stroke, 36 014 (15 365 women [42.7\%]; median [IQR] age, 70 [59-79] years) developed intracerebral hemorrhage, and 11 800 (7924 women [67.2\%]; median [IQR] age, 64 [53-75] years) developed subarachnoid hemorrhage. In all 3 stroke types, median ages at onset increased, and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and World Federation of Neurological Surgeons scores decreased throughout the 20-year period on multivariable analysis. In ischemic stroke, the proportion of favorable outcomes showed an increase over time after age adjustment (odds ratio [OR], 1.020; 95\% CI, 1.015-1.024 for women vs OR, 1.015; 95\% CI, 1.011-1.018 for men) but then stagnated, or even decreased in men, on multivariate adjustment including reperfusion therapy (OR, 0.997; 95\% CI, 0.991-1.003 for women vs OR, 0.990; 95\% CI, 0.985-0.994 for men). Unfavorable outcomes and in-hospital deaths decreased in both sexes. In intracerebral hemorrhage, favorable outcomes decreased in both sexes, and unfavorable outcomes and deaths decreased only in women. In subarachnoid hemorrhage, the proportion of favorable outcomes was unchanged, and that of unfavorable outcomes and deaths decreased in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, functional outcomes improved in patients with ischemic stroke during the past 20 years in both sexes presumably partly owing to the development of acute reperfusion therapy. The outcomes of patients with hemorrhagic stroke did not clearly improve in the same period.},

Methods: To estimate the probability of successful treatment, we implemented a three-step approach comprising cloning, censoring, and inverse-probability weighting. Main Results: The 1,468 eligible individuals received a median of four (IQR: 4-5) likely effective drugs. In 87.1\% and 77.7\% of participants, this included linezolid and clofazimine, respectively. The adjusted probability of successful treatment (95\% CI) was 0.85 (0.81, 0.88) for 6 months of BDQ, 0.77 (0.73, 0.81) for 7-11 months, and 0.86 (0.83, 0.88) for {$>$} 12 months. Compared with 6 months of bedaquiline, the ratio of treatment success (95\% CI) was 0.91 (0.85, 0.96) for 7-11 months and 1.01 (0.96, 1.06) for {$>$} 12 months. Na\"ive analyses that did not account for bias found a higher probability of successful treatment with {$>$} 12 months: ratio 1.09 (1.05, 1.14). Conclusions: Bedaquiline use beyond six months did not increase the probability of successful treatment among patients receiving longer regimens that commonly included new and repurposed drugs. When not properly accounted for, immortal person-time can bias estimate of effects of treatment duration. Future analyses should explore the effect of duration of bedaquiline and other drugs in subgroups with advanced disease and/or receiving less potent regimens.},

In status epilepticus, hypersynchronous epileptic activity lasts longer than the usual duration of isolated self-limited seizures (time t1), which causes neuronal damage or alteration of neuronal networks at a certain time point (time t2), depending on the type of and duration of status epilepticus. The successful management of status epilepticus includes both the early termination of seizure activity and the earliest possible identification of a causative etiology, which may require independent acute treatment. In nonconvulsive status epilepticus, patients present only with subtle clinical signs or even without any visible clinical manifestations. In these cases, EEG allows for the assessment of cerebral function and identification of patterns in need of urgent treatment.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether the recommended observation period of 7 days for cardiac arrest survivors is sufficient for conscious recovery and to identify the variables associated with eventual neurologic recovery among patients with delayed awakening. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A single tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: Five-hundred twenty-nine nontraumatic adult cardiac arrest survivors with prearrest favorable neurologic function (Cerebral Performance Category 1\textendash 2) who survived to hospital discharge during 2011\textendash 2019. INTERVENTIONS: The enrolled patients were classified into favorable (Cerebral Performance Category 1\textendash 2) and poor (Cerebral Performance Category 3\textendash 4) neurologic recovery according to their neurologic function at hospital discharge. Among patients with favorable neurologic recovery, those who recovered within 7 days were assigned to the early recovery group or after 7 days as the late recovery group. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 395 patients exhibiting favorable neurologic recovery (n = 357 in the early group, n = 38 in late group) and 134 patients exhibiting poor neurologic recovery (poor recovery group). Among patients who remained unconscious on day 7, delayed awakening was associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR], 3.905; 95\% CI, 1.153\textendash 13.221), prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (OR, 7.628; 95\% CI, 2.084\textendash 27.922), therapeutic hypothermia (OR, 4.320; 95\% CI, 1.624\textendash 11.488), and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OR, 4.508; 95\% CI, 1.414\textendash 14.371). Being transferred from another hospital, however, was less likely to be associated with delayed awakening (OR, 0.061; 95\% CI, 0.009\textendash 0.431). The median duration for patients to regain clear consciousness in the late recovery group was 12.12 days. No patient who recovered consciousness had an unfavorable electroencephalography pattern, however, in patients with poor recovery, the 7-day electroencephalography showed 45 patients with generalized suppression (33.6\%), two with burst suppression (1.5\%), 14 with seizure/epileptic discharge (10.5\%), and one with status epilepticus (0.7\%). CONCLUSIONS: Up to 9.6\% of cardiac arrest patients with favorable outcomes recover consciousness after the recommended 7 days of observation, indicating the observation time of 7 days seems justified but longer duration may be needed. The results of the culturally and clinically isolated population may limit the application to other population.},

The Statistical Update presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs). Methods: The American Heart Association, through its Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update. The 2022 Statistical Update is the product of a full year's worth of effort by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff members. This year's edition includes data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population and an enhanced focus on social determinants of health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, vascular contributions to brain health, and the global burden of cardiovascular disease and healthy life expectancy. Results: Each of the chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics. Conclusions: The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policymakers, media professionals, clinicians, health care administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions.},

  abstract = {Background: Severe traumatic brain injury often leads to death from withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, although prognosis is difficult to determine. Methods: To evaluate variation in mortality following the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and hospital mortality in patients with critical illness and severe traumatic brain injury, we conducted a two-year multicentre retrospective cohort study in six Canadian level-one trauma centres. The effect of centre on hospital mortality and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for baseline patient-level covariates (sex, age, pupillary reactivity and score on the Glasgow coma scale). Results: We randomly selected 720 patients with traumatic brain injury for our study. The overall hospital mortality among these patients was 228/720 (31.7\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 28.4\%\textendash 35.2\%) and ranged from 10.8\% to 44.2\% across centres ({$\chi$}2 test for overall difference, p {$<$} 0.001). Most deaths (70.2\% [160/228], 95\% CI 63.9\%\textendash 75.7\%) were associated with withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, ranging from 45.0\% (18/40) to 86.8\% (46/53) ({$\chi$}2 test for overall difference, p {$<$} 0.001) across centres. Adjusted odd ratios (ORs) for the effect of centre on hospital mortality ranged from 0.61 to 1.55 (p {$<$} 0.001). The incidence of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy varied by centre, with ORs ranging from 0.42 to 2.40 (p = 0.001). About one half of deaths that occurred following the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies happened within the first three days of care. Interpretation: We observed significant variation in mortality across centres. This may be explained in part by regional variations in physician, family or community approaches to the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. Considering the high proportion of early deaths associated with the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and the limited accuracy of current prognostic indicators, caution should be used regarding early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy following severe traumatic brain injury.},

Selective publication of clinical trials \textemdash{} and the outcomes within those trials \textemdash{} can lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent risk\textendash benefit ratio. METHODS We obtained reviews from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for studies of 12 antidepressant agents involving 12,564 patients. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify matching publications. For trials that were reported in the literature, we compared the published outcomes with the FDA outcomes. We also compared the effect size derived from the published reports with the effect size derived from the entire FDA data set. N Engl J Med 2008;358:252-60. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2008 Massachusetts Medical Society. RESULTS Among 74 FDA-registered studies, 31\%, accounting for 3449 study participants, were not published. Whether and how the studies were published were associated with the study outcome. A total of 37 studies viewed by the FDA as having positive results were published; 1 study viewed as positive was not published. Studies viewed by the FDA as having negative or questionable results were, with 3 exceptions, either not published (22 studies) or published in a way that, in our opinion, conveyed a positive outcome (11 studies). According to the published literature, it appeared that 94\% of the trials conducted were positive. By contrast, the FDA analysis showed that 51\% were positive. Separate meta-analyses of the FDA and journal data sets showed that the increase in effect size ranged from 11 to 69\% for individual drugs and was 32\% overall. CONCLUSIONS We cannot determine whether the bias observed resulted from a failure to submit manuscripts on the part of authors and sponsors, from decisions by journal editors and reviewers not to publish, or both. Selective reporting of clinical trial results may have adverse consequences for researchers, study participants, health care professionals, and patients.},

  abstract = {Researchers commonly make dichotomous claims based on continuous test statistics. Many have branded the practice as misuse of statistics, and criticize scientists for suffering from ``dichotomania''. However, the role dichotomous claims play in science is not primarily a statistical one, but an epistemological and pragmatic one. The epistemological function of dichotomous claims consists in transforming data into factual statements that can falsify a universal statement. This transformation requires pre-specified methodological decision procedures such as statistical hypothesis testing (e.g., Neyman-Pearson tests). From the perspective of methodological falsificationism these decision procedures are necessary, as probabilistic statements (e.g. continuous test statistics) cannot function as falsifiers of substantive hypotheses. However, they are not sufficient since for dichotomous claims to have any implication regarding theoretical claims about phenomena, there should be a valid derivation chain linking theoretical, experimental and data models. The pragmatic function of dichotomous claims is facilitating scrutiny and criticism among peers by generating contestable statements, a process referred to by Popper as 'conjectures and refutations', through which we can determine which theories withstand scrutiny the best. Abandoning dichotomous claims to combat the misuse of statistics would not improve scientific inferences but will sacrifice these crucial epistemic and pragmatic functions.},

Updated guidelines state that in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusions presenting beyond 6 hours from time last known well, advanced imaging selection including perfusion-based selection is necessary. Centers that receive patients with acute stroke must now have the capability to perform and interpret CT or magnetic resonance perfusion imaging or provide rapid transfer to centers with the capability of selecting patients for a highly impactful endovascular therapy, particularly in delayed time windows. Many stroke centers are quickly incorporating the use of automated perfusion processing software to interpret perfusion raw data. As CT perfusion (CTP) is being assimilated in real-world clinical practice, it is essential to understand the basics of perfusion acquisition, quantification, and interpretation. It is equally important to recognize the common technical and clinical diagnostic challenges of automated CTP including ischemic core and penumbral misclassifications that could result in underestimation or overestimation of the core and penumbra volumes. This review highlights the pitfalls of automated CTP along with practical pearls to address the common challenges. This is particularly tailored to aid the acute stroke clinician who must interpret automated perfusion studies in an emergency setting to make time-dependent treatment decisions for patients with acute ischemic stroke.},

  abstract = {Background Malignant infarction of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is associated with an 80\% mortality rate. Non-randomised studies have suggested that decompressive surgery reduces this mortality without increasing the number of severely disabled survivors. To obtain sufficient data as soon as possible to reliably estimate the effects of decompressive surgery, results from three European randomised controlled trials (DECIMAL, DESTINY, HAMLET) were pooled. The trials were ongoing when the pooled analysis was planned. Methods Individual data for patients aged between 18 years and 60 years, with space-occupying MCA infarction, included in one of the three trials, and treated within 48 h after stroke onset were pooled for analysis. The protocol was designed prospectively when the trials were still recruiting patients and outcomes were defined without knowledge of the results of the individual trials. The primary outcome measure was the score on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 1 year dichotomised between favourable (0\textendash 4) and unfavourable (5 and death) outcome. Secondary outcome measures included case fatality rate at 1 year and a dichotomisation of the mRS between 0\textendash 3 and 4 to death. Data analysis was done by an independent data monitoring committee. Findings 93 patients were included in the pooled analysis. More patients in the decompressive-surgery group than in the control group had an mRS{$\leq$}4 (75\% vs 24\%; pooled absolute risk reduction 51\% [95\% CI 34\textendash 69]), an mRS{$\leq$}3 (43\% vs 21\%; 23\% [5\textendash 41]), and survived (78\% vs 29\%; 50\% [33\textendash 67]), indicating numbers needed to treat of two for survival with mRS{$\leq$}4, four for survival with mRS{$\leq$}3, and two for survival irrespective of functional outcome. The effect of surgery was highly consistent across the three trials. Interpretation In patients with malignant MCA infarction, decompressive surgery undertaken within 48 h of stroke onset reduces mortality and increases the number of patients with a favourable functional outcome. The decision to perform decompressive surgery should, however, be made on an individual basis in every patient.},

A significant proportion of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage are transferred to large stroke treatment centers, such as Comprehensive Stroke Centers, because of perceived need for higher level of care. However, evidence of improvement in patient-centered outcomes for these patients treated at larger stroke treatment centers as compared to community hospitals is lacking. ``Efficient Resource Utilization for Patients with Intracerebral Hemorrhage (EnRICH)'' is a prospective, multisite, state-wide, cohort study designed to assess the impact of level of care on long-term patient-centered outcomes for patients with primary / non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage. The study is funded by the Texas state legislature via the Lone Star Stroke Research Consortium. It is being implemented via major hub hospitals in large metropolitan cities across the state of Texas. Each hub has an extensive network of ``spoke'' hospitals, which are connected to the hub via traditional clinical and administrative arrangements, or by telemedicine technologies. This infrastructure provides a unique opportunity to track outcomes for intracerebral hemorrhage patients managed across a health system at various levels of care. Eligible patients are enrolled during hospitalization and are followed for functional, quality of life, cognitive, resource utilization, and dependency outcomes at 30 and 90 days post discharge. As a secondary aim, an economic analysis of the incremental cost-effectiveness of treating intracerebral hemorrhage patients at higher levels of care will be conducted. Findings from EnRICH will provide much needed evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of regionalized care for intracerebral hemorrhage patients. Such evidence is required to inform policy and streamline clinical decision-making.}

  abstract = {We discuss a newly published study examining how phrases are used in clinical trials to describe results when the estimated P-value is close to (slightly above or slightly below) 0.05, which has been arbitrarily designated by convention as the boundary for `statistical significance'. Terms such as `marginally significant', `trending towards significant', and `nominally significant' are well represented in biomedical literature, but are not actually scientifically meaningful. Acknowledging that `statistical significance' remains a major determinant of publication, we propose that scientific journals de-emphasise the use of P-values for null hypothesis significance testing, a purpose for which they were never intended, and avoid the use of these ambiguous and confusing terms in scientific articles. Instead, investigators could simply report their findings: effect sizes, P-values, and confidence intervals (or their Bayesian equivalents), and leave it to the discerning reader to infer the clinical applicability and importance. Our goal should be to move away from describing studies (or trials) as positive or negative based on an arbitrary P-value threshold, and rather to judge whether the scientific evidence provided is informative or uninformative.},

  abstract = {Rationale: In December 2016, a single-center study describing significant improvements in mortality among a small group of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock treated with hydrocortisone, high-dose ascorbic acid, and thiamine (HAT therapy) was published online. Objectives: This study aims to describe the administration of HAT therapy among U.S. adults with septic shock before and after study publication and to compare outcomes between patients who received and did not receive HAT therapy. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 379 acute care hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database including patients discharged from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2018. Exposure was quarter year of hospital discharge; postpublication was defined as January 2017 onward (July 2017 for effectiveness analyses). The primary outcome was receipt of HAT at least once during hospitalization. We conducted unadjusted segmented regression analyses to examine temporal trends in HAT administration. In patients with early septic shock, we compared the association of early HAT therapy (within 2 d of hospitalization) with hospital mortality using multivariable modeling and propensity score matching. Measurements and Main Results: Among 338,597 patients, 3,574 (1.1\%) received HAT therapy, 98.7\% in the postpublication period. HAT administration increased from 0.03\% of patients (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.02\textendash 0.04) before publication to 2.65\% (95\% CI, 2.46\textendash 2.83) in the last quarter, with a significant step up in use after December 2016 (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Receipt of early HAT was associated with higher hospital mortality (28.2\% vs. 19.7\%; P\,{$<$}\,0.001; adjusted odds ratio, 1.17 [95\% CI, 1.02\textendash 1.33]; primary propensity-matched model adjusted odds ratio, 1.19 [95\% CI, 1.02\textendash 1.40]). Conclusions: Publication of a single-center retrospective study was associated with significantly increased administration of HAT. Among patients with early septic shock, receipt of HAT was not associated with mortality benefit.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The appropriate duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients at high risk for bleeding after the implantation of a drug-eluting coronary stent remains unclear. METHODS One month after they had undergone implantation of a biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting coronary stent, we randomly assigned patients at high bleeding risk to discontinue dual antiplatelet therapy immediately (abbreviated therapy) or to continue it for at least 2 additional months (standard therapy). The three ranked primary outcomes were net adverse clinical events (a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or major bleeding), major adverse cardiac or cerebral events (a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, or stroke), and major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding; cumulative incidences were assessed at 335 days. The first two outcomes were assessed for noninferiority in the per-protocol population, and the third outcome for superiority in the intention-to-treat population. RESULTS Among the 4434 patients in the per-protocol population, net adverse clinical events occurred in 165 patients (7.5\%) in the abbreviated-therapy group and in 172 (7.7\%) in the standard-therapy group (difference, -0.23 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -1.80 to 1.33; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority). A total of 133 patients (6.1\%) in the abbreviated-therapy group and 132 patients (5.9\%) in the standard-therapy group had a major adverse cardiac or cerebral event (difference, 0.11 percentage points; 95\% CI, -1.29 to 1.51; P\,=\,0.001 for noninferiority). Among the 4579 patients in the intention-to-treat population, major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 148 patients (6.5\%) in the abbreviated-therapy group and in 211 (9.4\%) in the standard-therapy group (difference, -2.82 percentage points; 95\% CI, -4.40 to -1.24; P{$<$}0.001 for superiority).

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate the relationship between ICU admission and outcomes for elderly patients with pneumonia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries (aged {$>$}64 years) admitted to 2988 acute care hospitals in the United States with pneumonia from 2010 to 2012. EXPOSURES ICU admission vs general ward admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included Medicare spending and hospital costs. Patient and hospital characteristics were adjusted to account for differences between patients with and without ICU admission. To account for unmeasured confounding, an instrumental variable was used\textemdash the differential distance to a hospital with high ICU admission (defined as any hospital in the upper 2 quintiles of ICU use). RESULTS Among 1 112 394 Medicare beneficiaries with pneumonia, 328 404 (30\%) were admitted to the ICU. In unadjusted analyses, patients admitted to the ICU had significantly higher 30-day mortality, Medicare spending, and hospital costs than patients admitted to a general hospital ward. Patients (n = 553 597) living closer than the median differential distance ({$<$}3.3 miles) to a hospital with high ICU admission were significantly more likely to be admitted to the ICU than patients living farther away (n = 558 797) (36\% for patients living closer vs 23\% for patients living farther, P {$<$} .001). In adjusted analyses, for the 13\% of patients whose ICU admission decision appeared to be discretionary (dependent only on distance), ICU admission was associated with a significantly lower adjusted 30-day mortality (14.8\% for ICU admission vs 20.5\% for general ward admission, P = .02; absolute decrease, -5.7\% [95\% CI, -10.6\%, -0.9\%]), yet there were no significant differences in Medicare spending or hospital costs for the hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with pneumonia, ICU admission of patients for whom the decision appeared to be discretionary was associated with improved survival and no significant difference in costs. A randomized trial may be warranted to assess whether more liberal ICU admission policies improve mortality for patients with pneumonia.},

  abstract = {Purpose\hspace{0.6em} In order to enable cost-utility analysis of shoulder pain conditions and treatments, this study aimed to develop and evaluate mapping algorithms to estimate the EQ-5D health index from the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) when health outcomes are only assessed with the OSS. Methods\hspace{0.6em} 5437 paired OSS and EQ-5D questionnaire responses from four national multicentre randomised controlled trials investigating different shoulder pathologies and treatments were split into training and testing samples. Separate EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L analyses were undertaken. Transfer to utility (TTU) regression (univariate linear, polynomial, spline, multivariable linear, two-part logistic-linear, tobit and adjusted limited dependent variable mixture models) and response mapping (ordered logistic regression and seemingly unrelated regression (SUR)) models were developed on the training sample. These were internally validated, and their performance evaluated on the testing sample. Model performance was evaluated over 100-fold repeated training\textendash testing sample splits. Results\hspace{0.6em} For the EQ-5D-3L analysis, the multivariable linear and splines models had the lowest mean square error (MSE) of 0.0415. The SUR model had the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.136. Model performance was greatest in the midrange and best health states, and lowest in poor health states. For the EQ-5D-5L analyses, the multivariable linear and splines models had the lowest MSE (0.0241\textendash 0.0278) while the SUR models had the lowest MAE (0.105\textendash 0.113). Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} The developed models now allow accurate estimation of the EQ-5D health index when only the OSS responses are available as a measure of patient-reported health outcome.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite regular criticisms of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), a focus on testing persists, sometimes in the belief to get published and sometimes encouraged by journal reviewers. This paper aims to demonstrate known key limitations of NHST using simple nontechnical illustrations. Design: The first illustration is based on simulated data of 20 000 studies that compare two groups for an outcome event. The true effect size (difference in event rates) and sample size (20-100 per group) were varied. The second illustration used real data from a meta-analysis on alpha-blockers for the treatment of ureteric stones. Results: The simulations demonstrated the large between-study variability in Pvalues (range between {$<$}.0001 and 1 for most simulation conditions). A focus on statistically significant effects (P {$<$} .05), notably in small to moderate samples, led to strongly overestimated effect sizes (up to 240\%) and many false-positive conclusions, that is statistically significant effects that were, in fact, true null effects. Effect sizes also exerted strong between-study variability, but confidence intervals accounted for this: the interval width decreased with larger sample size, and the percentage of intervals that contained the true effect size was accurate across simulation conditions. Reducing alpha level, as recently suggested, reduced false-positive conclusions but strongly increased the overestimation of significant effects (up to 320\%). Conclusions: Researchers and journals should abandon statistical significance as a pivotal element in most scientific publications. Confidence intervals around effect sizes are more informative, but should not merely be reported to comply with journal requirements.},

The overall quality of medical research remains poor, despite longstanding criticisms. The problems are well known, but the research community fails to properly address them. We suggest that most problems stem from an underlying paradox: although methodology is undeniably the backbone of high-quality and responsible research, science consistently undervalues methodology. The focus remains more on the destination (research claims and metrics) than on the journey. Notwithstanding, research should serve society more than the reputation of those involved. While we notice that many initiatives are being established to improve components of the research cycle, these initiatives are too disjointed. The overall system is monolithic and slow to adapt. We assert that top-down action is needed from journals, universities, funders and governments to break the cycle and put methodology first. These actions should involve the widespread adoption of registered reports, balanced research funding between innovative, incremental and methodological research projects, full recognition and demystification of peer review, improved methodological review of reports, adherence to reporting guidelines, and investment in methodological education and research. Currently, the scientific enterprise is doing a major disservice to patients and society.},

Poor reporting hampers the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of a study and the generalisability of its results. Taking into account empirical evidence and theoretical considerations, a group of methodologists, researchers, and editors developed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations to improve the quality of reporting of observational studies. The STROBE Statement consists of a checklist of 22 items, which relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to cohort studies, casecontrol studies and cross-sectional studies and four are specific to each of the three study designs. The STROBE Statement provides guidance to authors about how to improve the reporting of observational studies and facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of studies by reviewers, journal editors and readers. This explanatory and elaboration document is intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the STROBE Statement. The meaning and rationale for each checklist item are presented. For each item, one or several published examples and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature are provided. Examples of useful flow diagrams are also included. The STROBE Statement, this document, and the associated Web site (http://www. strobe-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of observational research.},

In this narrative review, current evidence on routine fluid management of critically ill brain-injured patients and use of haemodynamic monitoring is summarized. Pertinent guidelines and consensus statements on fluid management for brain-injured patients are highlighted. In general, existing guidelines indicate that fluid management in these neurocritical care patients should be targeted at euvolemia using isotonic fluids. A critical appraisal is made of the available literature regarding the appropriate amount of fluids, haemodynamic monitoring and which types of fluids should be administered or avoided and a practical approach to fluid management is elaborated. Although hypovolemia is bound to contribute to secondary brain injury, some more recent data have emerged indicating the potential risks of fluid overload. However, it is acknowledged that many factors govern the relationship between fluid management and cerebral blood flow and oxygenation and more research seems warranted to optimise fluid management and improve outcomes.},

If there is only one unmeasured confounding variable on the graph, then nonincreasing or nondecreasing average causal effects suffice to draw conclusions about the direction of the bias. When there are more than one unmeasured confounding variable, nonincreasing and nondecreasing average causal effects can be used to draw conclusions only if the various unmeasured confounding variables are independent of one another conditional on the measured covariates. When this conditional independence property does not hold, stronger notions of monotonicity are needed to draw conclusions about the direction of the bias.},

  abstract = {Objective: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinical trials based on single end points only partially capture the full treatment effect when both function and mortality are affected, and may falsely dismiss efficacious drugs as futile. We aimed to investigate the statistical properties of several strategies for the simultaneous analysis of function and mortality in ALS clinical trials. Methods: Based on the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) database, we simulated longitudinal patterns of functional decline, defined by the revised amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) and conditional survival time. Different treatment scenarios with varying effect sizes were simulated with follow-up ranging from 12 to 18 months. We considered the following analytical strategies: 1) Cox model; 2) linear mixed effects (LME) model; 3) omnibus test based on Cox and LME models; 4) composite time-to-6-point decrease or death; 5) combined assessment of function and survival (CAFS); and 6) test based on joint modeling framework. For each analytical strategy, we calculated the empirical power and sample size. Results: Both Cox and LME models have increased false-negative rates when treatment exclusively affects either function or survival. The joint model has superior power compared to other strategies. The composite end point increases false-negative rates among all treatment scenarios. To detect a 15\% reduction in ALSFRS-R decline and 34\% decline in hazard with 80\% power after 18 months, the Cox model requires 524 patients, the LME model 794 patients, the omnibus test 526 patients, the composite end point 1,274 patients, the CAFS 576 patients and the joint model 464 patients. Conclusion: Joint models have superior statistical power to analyze simultaneous effects on survival and function and may circumvent pitfalls encountered by other end points. Optimizing trial end points is essential, as selecting suboptimal outcomes may disguise important treatment clues.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Research on intravenous fluid therapy and its side effects, volume, sodium, and chloride overload, has focused almost exclusively on the resuscitation setting. We aimed to quantify all fluid sources in the ICU and assess fluid creep, the hidden and unintentional volume administered as a vehicle for medication or electrolytes. METHODS: We precisely recorded the volume, sodium, and chloride burdens imposed by every fluid source administered to 14,654 patients during the cumulative 103,098~days they resided in our 45-bed tertiary ICU and simulated the impact of important strategic fluid choices on patients' chloride burdens. In septic patients, we assessed the impact of the different fluid sources on cumulative fluid balance, an established marker of morbidity. RESULTS: Maintenance and replacement fluids accounted for 24.7\% of the mean daily total fluid volume, thereby far exceeding resuscitation fluids (6.5\%) and were the most important sources of sodium and chloride. Fluid creep represented a striking 32.6\% of the mean daily total fluid volume [median 645~mL (IQR 308-1039~mL)]. Chloride levels can be more effectively reduced by adopting a hypotonic maintenance strategy [a daily difference in chloride burden of 30.8~mmol (95\% CI 30.5-31.1)] than a balanced resuscitation strategy [daily difference 3.0~mmol (95\% CI 2.9-3.1)]. In septic patients, non-resuscitation fluids had a larger absolute impact on cumulative fluid balance than did resuscitation fluids. CONCLUSIONS: Inadvertent daily volume, sodium, and chloride loading should be avoided when prescribing maintenance fluids in view of the vast amounts of fluid creep. This is especially important when adopting an isotonic maintenance strategy.},

If the effect of measurement error is misjudged, the data analyses are hampered and the validity of the study's inferences may be affected. In this paper, we describe five myths that contribute to misjudgments about measurement error, regarding expected structure, impact and solutions to mitigate the problems resulting from mismeasurements. The aim is to clarify these measurement error misconceptions. We show that the influence of measurement error in an epidemiological data analysis can play out in ways that go beyond simple heuristics, such as heuristics about whether or not to expect attenuation of the effect estimates. Whereas we encourage epidemiologists to deliberate about the structure and potential impact of measurement error in their analyses, we also recommend exercising restraint when making claims about the magnitude or even direction of effect of measurement error if not accompanied by statistical measurement error corrections or quantitative bias analysis. Suggestions for alleviating the problems or investigating the structure and magnitude of measurement error are given.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} In patients with severe brain injury, withdrawal of life-sustaining measures (WLSM) is common in intensive care units (ICU). WLSM constitutes a dilemma: instituting WLSM too early could result in death despite the possibility of an acceptable functional outcome, whereas delaying WLSM could unnecessarily burden patients, families, clinicians, and hospital resources. We aimed to describe the occurrence and timing of WLSM, and factors associated with timing of WLSM in European ICUs in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods:\hspace{0.6em} The CENTER-TBI Study is a prospective multi-center cohort study. For the current study, patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) admitted to the ICU and aged 16 or older were included. Occurrence and timing of WLSM were documented. For the analyses, we dichotomized timing of WLSM in early ({$<$}\,72 h after injury) versus later ({$\geq$}\,72 h after injury) based on recent guideline recommendations. We assessed factors associated with initiating WLSM early versus later, including geographic region, center, patient, injury, and treatment characteristics with univariable and multivariable (mixed effects) logistic regression. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 2022 patients aged 16 or older were admitted to the ICU. ICU mortality was 13\% (n\,=\,267). Of these, 229 (86\%) patients died after WLSM, and were included in the analyses. The occurrence of WLSM varied between regions ranging from 0\% in Eastern Europe to 96\% in Northern Europe. In 51\% of the patients, WLSM was early. Patients in the early WLSM group had a lower maximum therapy intensity level (TIL) score than patients in the later WLSM group (median of 5 versus 10) The strongest independent variables associated with early WLSM were one unreactive pupil (odds ratio (OR) 4.0, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.3\textendash 12.4) or two unreactive pupils (OR 5.8, CI 2.6\textendash 13.1) compared to two reactive pupils, and an Injury Severity Score (ISS) if over 41 (OR per point above 41\,=\,1.1, CI 1.0\textendash 1.1). Timing of WLSM was not significantly associated with region or center. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} WLSM occurs early in half of the patients, mostly in patients with severe TBI affecting brainstem reflexes who were severely injured. We found no regional or center influences in timing of WLSM. Whether WLSM is always appropriate or may contribute to a self-fulfilling prophecy requires further research and argues for reluctance to institute WLSM early in case of any doubt on prognosis.},

Moreover, these problems become more severe if the power is low. These issues clearly deserve our attention. They have been studied mostly through empirical observation and simulation, while there are relatively few mathematical results. Here we study them both from the frequentist and the Bayesian perspective. We prove that the relative bias of the magnitude is a decreasing function of the power and that the usual confidence interval undercovers when the power is less than 50\%. We conclude that it is important to apply the appropriate amount of shrinkage to counter the winner's curse.},

  abstract = {Obtaining accurate estimates of the causal effects of socioeconomic position (SEP) on health is important for public health interventions. To do this, researchers must identify and adjust for all potential confounding variables, while avoiding inappropriate adjustment for mediator variables on a causal pathway between the exposure and outcome. Unfortunately, `overadjustment bias' remains a common and under-recognized problem in social epidemiology. This paper offers an introduction on selecting appropriate variables for adjustment when examining effects of SEP on health, with a focus on overadjustment bias. We discuss the challenges of estimating different causal effects including overadjustment bias, provide guidance on overcoming them, and consider specific issues including the timing of variables across the life-course, mutual adjustment for socioeconomic indicators, and conducting systematic reviews. We recommend three key steps to select the most appropriate variables for adjustment. First, researchers should be clear about their research question and causal effect of interest. Second, using expert knowledge and theory, researchers should draw causal diagrams representing their assumptions about the interrelationships between their variables of interest. Third, based on their causal diagram(s) and causal effect(s) of interest, researchers should select the most appropriate set of variables, which maximizes adjustment for confounding while minimizing adjustment for mediators.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a devastating disease leaving surviving patients often severely disabled. Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) has been identified as one of the main contributors to poor clinical outcome after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The objective of this review is to summarize existing clinical evidence assessing the diagnostic value of invasive neuromonitoring (INM) in detecting DCI and provide an update of evidence since the 2014 consensus statement on multimodality monitoring in neurocritical care. METHODS: Three invasive monitoring techniques were targeted in the data collection process: brain tissue oxygen tension (ptiO2), cerebral microdialysis, and electrocorticography. Prospective and retrospective studies as well as case series ({$\geq$}10 patients) were included as long as monitoring was used to detect DCI or guide DCI treatment. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies reporting INM in the context of DCI were included (ptiO2: N=21; cerebral microdialysis: N=22; electrocorticography: N=4). Changes in brain oxygen tension are associated with angiographic vasospasm or reduction in regional cerebral blood flow. Metabolic monitoring with trend analysis of the lactate to pyruvate ratio using cerebral microdialysis, identifies patients at risk for DCI. Clusters of cortical spreading depolarizations are associated with clinical neurological worsening and cerebral infarction in selected patients receiving electrocorticography monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Data supports the use of INM for the detection of DCI in selected patients. Generalizability to all subarachnoid hemorrhage patients is limited by design bias of available studies and lack of randomized trials. Continuous data recording with trend analysis and the combination of INM modalities can provide tailored treatment support in patients at high risk for DCI. Future trials should test interventions triggered by INM in relation to cerebral infarctions.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine if posttraumatic nonconvulsive electrographic seizures result in longterm brain atrophy. Methods: Prospective continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring was done in 140 patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and in-depth study of 16 selected patients was done using serial volumetric MRI acutely and at 6 months after TBI. Fluorodeoxyglucose PET was done in the acute stage in 14/16 patients. These data were retrospectively analyzed after collection of data for 7 years. Results: cEEG detected seizures in 32/140 (23\%) of the entire cohort. In the selected imaging subgroup, 6 patients with seizures were compared with a cohort of 10 age- and GCS-matched patients with TBI without seizures. In this subgroup, the seizures were repetitive and constituted status epilepticus in 4/6 patients. Patients with seizures had greater hippocampal atrophy as compared to those without seizures (21 Ϯ 9 vs 12 Ϯ 6\%, p ϭ 0.017). Hippocampi ipsilateral to the electrographic seizure focus demonstrated a greater degree of volumetric atrophy as compared with nonseizure hippocampi (28 Ϯ 5 vs 13 Ϯ 9\%, p ϭ 0.007). A single patient had an ictal PET scan which demonstrated increased hippocampal glucose uptake. Conclusion: Acute posttraumatic nonconvulsive seizures occur frequently after TBI and, in a selected subgroup, appear to be associated with disproportionate long-term hippocampal atrophy. These data suggest anatomic damage is potentially elicited by nonconvulsive seizures in the acute postinjury setting. Neurology\textregistered{} 2010;75:792\textendash 798},

Despite decades of research and multiple randomized clinical trials, a specific therapeutic for sepsis is not available. The evaluation of therapeutics targeting components of host response anomalies in patients with sepsis has been complicated by the inability to identify those in this very heterogeneous population who are more likely to benefit from a specific intervention. Additionally, multiple and diverse host response aberrations often co-exist in sepsis, and knowledge of which dysregulated biological organ system or pathway drives sepsis-induced pathology in an individual patient is limited, further complicating the development of effective therapies. Here, we discuss the drawbacks of previous attempts to develop sepsis therapeutics and delineate a future wherein interventions will be based on the host response profile of a patient.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Sepsis survivors face increased risk for cardiovascular complications; however, the contribution of intrasepsis events to cardiovascular risk profiles is unclear. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and Intermountain Healthcare (IH) integrated healthcare delivery systems. SUBJECTS: Sepsis survivors (2011\textendash 2017 [KPNC] and 2018\textendash 2020 [IH]) greater than or equal to 40 years old without prior cardiovascular disease. DESIGN: Data across KPNC and IH were harmonized and grouped into presepsis (demographics, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease scores, comorbidities) or intrasepsis factors (e.g., laboratory values, vital signs, organ support, infection source) with random split for training/internal validation datasets (75\%/25\%) within KPNC and IH. Models were bidirectionally, externally validated between healthcare systems. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Changes to predictive accuracy (C-statistic) of cause-specific proportional hazards models predicting 1-year cardiovascular outcomes (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation events) were compared between models that did and did not contain intrasepsis factors. Among 39,590 KPNC and 16,388 IH sepsis survivors, 3,503 (8.8\%) at Kaiser Permanente (KP) and 600 (3.7\%) at IH experienced a cardiovascular event within 1-year after hospital discharge, including 996 (2.5\%) at KP and 192 (1.2\%) IH with an atherosclerotic event first, 564 (1.4\%) at KP and 117 (0.7\%) IH with a heart failure event, 2,310 (5.8\%) at KP and 371 (2.3\%) with an atrial fibrillation event. Death within 1 year after sepsis occurred for 7,948 (20\%) KP and 2,085 (12.7\%) IH patients. Combined models with presepsis and intrasepsis factors had better discrimination for cardiovascular events (KPNC C-statistic 0.783 [95\% CI, 0.766\textendash 0.799]; IH 0.763 [0.726\textendash 0.801]) as compared with presepsis cardiovascular risk alone (KPNC: 0.666 [0.648\textendash 0.683], IH 0.660 [0.619\textendash 0.702]) during internal validation. External validation of models across healthcare systems showed similar performance (KPNC model within IH data C-statistic: 0.734 [0.725\textendash 0.744]; IH model within KPNC data: 0.787 [0.768\textendash 0.805]). CONCLUSIONS: Across two large healthcare systems, intrasepsis factors improved postsepsis cardiovascular risk prediction as compared with presepsis cardiovascular risk profiles. Further exploration of sepsis factors that contribute to postsepsis cardiovascular events is warranted for improved mechanistic and predictive models.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate how often subgroup claims reported in the abstracts of RCTs are actually supported by statistical evidence (P {$<$} .05 from an interaction test) and corroborated by subsequent RCTs and meta-analyses. DATA SOURCES This meta-epidemiological survey examines data sets of trials with at least 1 subgroup claim, including Subgroup Analysis of Trials Is Rarely Easy (SATIRE) articles and Discontinuation of Randomized Trials (DISCO) articles. We used Scopus (updated July 2016) to search for English-language articles citing each of the eligible index articles with at least 1 subgroup finding in the abstract. STUDY SELECTION Articles with a subgroup claim in the abstract with or without evidence of statistical heterogeneity (P {$<$} .05 from an interaction test) in the text and articles attempting to corroborate the subgroup findings. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Study characteristics of trials with at least 1 subgroup claim in the abstract were recorded. Two reviewers extracted the data necessary to calculate subgroup-level effect sizes, standard errors, and the P values for interaction. For individual RCTs and meta-analyses that attempted to corroborate the subgroup findings from the index articles, trial characteristics were extracted. Cochran Q test was used to reevaluate heterogeneity with the data from all available trials. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The number of subgroup claims in the abstracts of RCTs, the number of subgroup claims in the abstracts of RCTs with statistical support (subgroup findings), and the number of subgroup findings corroborated by subsequent RCTs and meta-analyses. RESULTS Sixty-four eligible RCTs made a total of 117 subgroup claims in their abstracts. Of these 117 claims, only 46 (39.3\%) in 33 articles had evidence of statistically significant heterogeneity from a test for interaction. In addition, out of these 46 subgroup findings, only 16 (34.8\%) ensured balance between randomization groups within the subgroups (eg, through stratified randomization), 13 (28.3\%) entailed a prespecified subgroup analysis, and 1 (2.2\%) was adjusted for multiple testing. Only 5 (10.9\%) of the 46 subgroup findings had at least 1 subsequent pure corroboration attempt by a meta-analysis or an RCT. In all 5 cases, the corroboration attempts found no evidence of a statistically significant subgroup effect. In addition, all effect sizes from meta-analyses were attenuated toward the null. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A minority of subgroup claims made in the abstracts of RCTs are supported by their own data (ie, a significant interaction effect). For those that have statistical support (P {$<$} .05 from an interaction test), most fail to meet other best practices for subgroup tests, including prespecification, stratified randomization, and adjustment for multiple testing. Attempts to corroborate statistically significant subgroup differences are rare; when done, the initially observed subgroup differences are not reproduced.},

We wondered how often statistically significant results in RCTs may be lost with small changes in the numbers of outcomes. Study Design and Setting: A review of RCTs in high-impact medical journals that reported a statistically significant result for at least one dichotomous or time-to-event outcome in the abstract. In the group with the smallest number of events, we changed the status of patients without an event to an event until the P-value exceeded 0.05. We labeled this number the Fragility Index; smaller numbers indicated a more fragile result. Results: The 399 eligible trials had a median sample size of 682 patients (range: 15e112,604) and a median of 112 events (range: 8e5,142); 53\% reported a P-value !0.01. The median Fragility Index was 8 (range: 0e109); 25\% had a Fragility Index of 3 or less. In 53\% of trials, the Fragility Index was less than the number of patients lost to follow-up. Conclusion: The statistically significant results of many RCTs hinge on small numbers of events. The Fragility Index complements the P-value and helps identify less robust results. \'O 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. Open access under CC BY-NC-ND license.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a significant risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Although ethnic/racial disparities related to hypertension and ICH have been reported, these previous studies were limited by a lack of Hispanics and inadequate power to analyze by ICH location. In the current study, while overcoming these prior limitations, we investigated whether there was variation by ethnicity/race of treated and untreated hypertension as risk factors for ICH. METHODS: The ERICH study (Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage) is a prospective, multicenter, case-control study of ICH among whites, blacks, and Hispanics. Cases were enrolled from 42 recruitment sites. Controls matched to cases 1:1 by age ({$\pm$}5 years), sex, ethnicity/race, and metropolitan area were identified by random-digit dialing. Subjects were interviewed to determine history of hypertension and use of antihypertensive medications. Cases and controls within ethnic groups were compared by using conditional logistic regression. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were computed for ICH as an overall group and separately for the location subcategories deep, lobar, and infratentorial (brainstem/cerebellar). RESULTS: Nine hundred fifty-eight white, 880 black, and 766 Hispanic ICH patients were enrolled. For ICH cases, untreated hypertension was higher in blacks (43.6\%, P{$<$}0.0001) and Hispanics (46.9\%, P{$<$}0.0001) versus whites (32.7\%). In multivariable analyses adjusted for alcohol use, anticoagulation, hypercholesterolemia, education, and medical insurance status, treated hypertension was a significant risk factor across all locations of ICH in whites (odds ratio [OR], 1.57; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.24\textendash 1.98; P{$<$}0.0001), blacks (OR, 3.02; 95\% CI, 2.16\textendash 4.22; P{$<$}0.0001), and Hispanics (OR, 2.50; 95\% CI, 1.73\textendash 3.62; P{$<$}0.0001). Untreated hypertension was a substantially greater risk factor for all 3 racial/ethnic groups across all locations of ICH: whites (OR, 8.79; 95\% CI, 5.66\textendash 13.66; P{$<$}0.0001), blacks (OR, 12.46; 95\% CI, 8.08\textendash 19.20; P{$<$}0.0001), and Hispanics (OR, 10.95; 95\% CI, 6.58\textendash 18.23; P{$<$}0.0001). There was an interaction between race/ethnicity and ICH risk (P{$<$}0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Untreated hypertension confers a greater ICH risk in blacks and Hispanics relative to whites across all anatomic locations of ICH. Accelerated research efforts are needed to improve overall hypertension treatment rates and to monitor the impact of such efforts on racial/ethnic disparities in stroke.},

  abstract = {Nonrandomized studies using insurance claims databases can be analyzed to produce real-world evidence on the effectiveness of medical products. Given the lack of baseline randomization and measurement issues, concerns exist about whether such studies produce unbiased treatment effect estimates.To emulate the design of 30 completed and 2 ongoing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of medications with database studies using observational analogues of the RCT design parameters (population, intervention, comparator, outcome, time [PICOT]) and to quantify agreement in RCT-database study pairs.New-user cohort studies with propensity score matching using 3 US claims databases (Optum Clinformatics, MarketScan, and Medicare). Inclusion-exclusion criteria for each database study were prespecified to emulate the corresponding RCT. RCTs were explicitly selected based on feasibility, including power, key confounders, and end points more likely to be emulated with real-world data. All 32 protocols were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov before conducting analyses. Emulations were conducted from 2017 through 2022.Therapies for multiple clinical conditions were included.Database study emulations focused on the primary outcome of the corresponding RCT. Findings of database studies were compared with RCTs using predefined metrics, including Pearson correlation coefficients and binary metrics based on statistical significance agreement, estimate agreement, and standardized difference.In these highly selected RCTs, the overall observed agreement between the RCT and the database emulation results was a Pearson correlation of 0.82 (95\% CI, 0.64-0.91), with 75\% meeting statistical significance, 66\% estimate agreement, and 75\% standardized difference agreement. In a post hoc analysis limited to 16 RCTs with closer emulation of trial design and measurements, concordance was higher (Pearson r, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.79-0.97; 94\% meeting statistical significance, 88\% estimate agreement, 88\% standardized difference agreement). Weaker concordance occurred among 16 RCTs for which close emulation of certain design elements that define the research question (PICOT) with data from insurance claims was not possible (Pearson r, 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.00-0.83; 56\% meeting statistical significance, 50\% estimate agreement, 69\% standardized difference agreement).Real-world evidence studies can reach similar conclusions as RCTs when design and measurements can be closely emulated, but this may be difficult to achieve. Concordance in results varied depending on the agreement metric. Emulation differences, chance, and residual confounding can contribute to divergence in results and are difficult to disentangle.},

When multiple MIDs for a given PROM differ substantially, the selection of an optimal MID to aid interpretation could prove challenging. This article describes a systematic, step-by-step selection approach developed to resolve this problem. An optimal MID, at least, should be methodologically sound and should, as far as possible, match the intended application contexts. Therefore, this approach is geared to explaining the variability of the MIDs for the PROM of interest by the methodological rigor and contextualised factors influencing the MID application, and where appropriate, provides one optimal MID (ie, the median of the selected estimates in a relatively narrow range).{$<$}/p{$>$}},

METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 202 centers in China involving patients with a minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) who carried CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles. Patients were assigned within 24 hours after symptom onset, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive ticagrelor (180 mg on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily on days 2 through 90) and placebo clopidogrel or to receive clopidogrel (300 mg on day 1 followed by 75 mg once daily on days 2 through 90) and placebo ticagrelor; both groups received aspirin for 21 days. The primary efficacy outcome was new stroke, and the primary safety outcome was severe or moderate bleeding, both within 90 days. RESULTS A total of 11,255 patients were screened and 6412 patients were enrolled, with 3205 assigned to the ticagrelor group and 3207 to the clopidogrel group. The median age of the patients was 64.8 years, and 33.8\% were women; 98.0\% belonged to the Han Chinese ethnic group. Stroke occurred within 90 days in 191 patients (6.0\%) in the ticagrelor group and 243 patients (7.6\%) in the clopidogrel group (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95\% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.94; P\,=\,0.008). Secondary outcomes were generally in the same direction as the primary outcome. Severe or moderate bleeding occurred in 9 patients (0.3\%) in the ticagrelor group and in 11 patients (0.3\%) in the clopidogrel group; any bleeding occurred in 170 patients (5.3\%) and 80 patients (2.5\%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Among Chinese patients with minor ischemic stroke or TIA who were carriers of CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles, the risk of stroke at 90 days was modestly lower with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel. The risk of severe or moderate bleeding did not differ between the two treatment groups, but ticagrelor was associated with more total bleeding events than clopidogrel.

  abstract = {Tenecteplase is a fibrinolytic drug with higher fibrin specificity and longer half-life than the standard stroke thrombolytic, alteplase, permitting the convenience of single bolus administration. Tenecteplase, at 0.5 mg/kg, has regulatory approval to treat ST-segment\textendash elevation myocardial infarction, for which it has equivalent 30-day mortality and fewer systemic hemorrhages. Investigated as a thrombolytic for ischemic stroke over the past 15 years, tenecteplase is currently being studied in several phase 3 trials. Based on a systematic literature search, we provide a qualitative synthesis of published stroke clinical trials of tenecteplase that (1) performed randomized comparisons with alteplase, (2) compared different doses of tenecteplase, or (3) provided unique quantitative meta-analyses. Four phase 2 and one phase 3 study performed randomized comparisons with alteplase. These and other phase 2 studies compared different tenecteplase doses and effects on early outcomes of recanalization, reperfusion, and substantial neurological improvement, as well as symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 3-month disability on the modified Rankin Scale. Although no single trial prospectively demonstrated superiority or noninferiority of tenecteplase on clinical outcome, meta-analyses of these trials (1585 patients randomized) point to tenecteplase superiority in recanalization of large vessel occlusions and noninferiority in disability-free 3-month outcome, without increases in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or mortality. Doses of 0.25 and 0.4 mg/kg have been tested, but no advantage of the higher dose has been suggested by the results. Current clinical practice guidelines for stroke include intravenous tenecteplase at either dose as a second-tier option, with the 0.25 mg/kg dose recommended for large vessel occlusions, based on a phase 2 trial that demonstrated superior recanalization and improved 3-month outcome relative to alteplase. Ongoing randomized phase 3 trials may better define the comparative risks and benefits of tenecteplase and alteplase for stroke thrombolysis and answer questions of tenecteplase efficacy in the {$>$}4.5-hour time window, in wakeup stroke, and in combination with endovascular thrombectomy.},

  abstract = {For more than 20 years, research has proven the beneficial effect of natural frequencies when it comes to solving Bayesian reasoning tasks (Gigerenzer and Hoffrage, 1995). In a recent meta-analysis, McDowell and Jacobs (2017) showed that presenting a task in natural frequency format increases performance rates to 24\% compared to only 4\% when the same task is presented in probability format. Nevertheless, on average three quarters of participants in their meta-analysis failed to obtain the correct solution for such a task in frequency format. In this paper, we present an empirical study on what participants typically do wrong when confronted with natural frequencies. We found that many of them did not actually use natural frequencies for their calculations, but translated them back into complicated probabilities instead. This switch from the intuitive presentation format to a less intuitive calculation format will be discussed within the framework of psychological theories (e.g., the Einstellung effect).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hematoma volume (HV) is a powerful determinant of outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage. We examined whether the effect of the iron chelator, deferoxamine, on functional outcome varied depending on HV in the i-DEF trial (Intracerebral Hemorrhage Deferoxamine). METHODS: A post hoc analysis of the i-DEF trial; participants were classified according to baseline HV (small {$<$}10 mL, moderate 10\textendash 30 mL, and large {$>$}30 mL). Favorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0\textendash 2 at day180; secondarily at day-90. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the differential treatment effect according to HV. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-one subjects were included in the as-treated analysis; 121 with small, 114 moderate, and 56 large HV. Day-180 modified Rankin Scale scores were available for 270/291 subjects (111 with small, 105 moderate, and 54 large HV). There was a differential effect of treatment according to HV on day-180 outcomes (P-for-interaction =0.0077); 50\% (27/54) of deferoxamine-treated patients with moderate HV had favorable outcome compared with 25.5\% (13/51) of placebo-treated subjects (adjusted odds ratio, 2.7 [95\% CI, 1.13\textendash 6.27]; P=0.0258). Treatment effect was not significant for small (adjusted odds ratio, 1.37 [95\% CI, 0.62\textendash 3.02]) or large (adjusted odds ratio, 0.12 [95\% CI, 0.01\textendash 1.05]) HV. Results for day-90 outcomes were comparable (P-for-interaction =0.0617). Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with moderate HV, a greater proportion of deferoxamine- than placebo-treated patients achieved modified Rankin Scale score 0\textendash 2. The treatment effect was not significant for small or large HVs. These findings have important trial design and therapeutic implications.},

We aimed to determine whether our algorithm for the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy decision would accurately identify patients with a high probability of poor outcome, despite aggressive treatment.         Design:~         Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.         Setting:~         Tertiary-care Neuro-ICU.         Patients:~         Intraparenchymal, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhage patients.         Interventions:~         Baseline demographics, clinical status, and hospital course were assessed to determine the predictors of in-hospital mortality and 12-month death/severe disability among patients receiving maximal therapy. Multivariable logistic regression models developed on maximal therapy patients were applied to patients who underwent withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy to predict their probable outcome had they continued maximal treatment. A validation cohort of propensity score\textendash matched patients was identified from the maximal therapy cohort, and their predicted and actual outcomes compared.         Measurements and Main Results:~         Of 383 patients enrolled, there were 128 subarachnoid hemorrhage (33.4\%), 134 subdural hematoma (35.0\%), and 121 intraparenchymal hemorrhage (31.6\%). Twenty-six patients (6.8\%) underwent withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and died, 41 (10.7\%) continued maximal therapy and died in hospital, and 316 (82.5\%) continued maximal therapy and survived to discharge. The median predicted probability of in-hospital death among withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy patients was 35\% had they continued maximal therapy, whereas the median predicted probability of 12-month death/severe disability was 98\%. In the propensity-matched validation cohort, 16 of 20 patients had greater than or equal to 80\% predicted probability of death/severe disability at 12 months, matching the observed outcomes and supporting the strength and validity of our prediction models.         Conclusions:~         The withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy decision may contribute to premature in-hospital death in some patients who may otherwise have been expected to survive to discharge. However, based on probability models, nearly all of the patients who underwent withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy would have died or remained severely disabled at 12 months had maximal therapy been continued. Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy may not represent a self-fulfilling prophecy.},

Thus, it is important to assess how patients are feeling and functioning when evaluating the effects of interventions to prevent or treat health conditions. Aspects of health that patients can report on directly, such as the severity of pain or limitations in physical functioning, are patient-reported outcomes.The recommended quantitative approach to measure these aspects of health status is to ask patients directly using a standardized questionnaire. Patient-reported outcome measures are reports of ``the status of a patient's health condition that comes directly from the patient without interpretation of the patient's response by a clinician or anyone else.'' An example of a patient-reported outcome measure, the Short Form 36 (SF-36), was used in a randomized clinical trial conducted by Ghogawala et al to compare 2 surgical approaches (ventral or dorsal) for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, which is a condition that can cause significant impairments in physical functioning.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In the phase 1\textendash 2 portion of an adaptive trial, REGEN-COV, a combination of the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab, reduced the viral load and number of medical visits in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). REGEN-COV has activity in vitro against current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern. METHODS In the phase 3 portion of an adaptive trial, we randomly assigned outpatients with Covid-19 and risk factors for severe disease to receive various doses of intravenous REGEN-COV or placebo. Patients were followed through day 29. A prespecified hierarchical analysis was used to assess the end points of hospitalization or death and the time to resolution of symptoms. Safety was also evaluated. RESULTS Covid-19\textendash related hospitalization or death from any cause occurred in 18 of 1355 patients in the REGEN-COV 2400-mg group (1.3\%) and in 62 of 1341 patients in the placebo group who underwent randomization concurrently (4.6\%) (relative risk reduction [1 minus the relative risk], 71.3\%; P{$<$}0.001); these outcomes occurred in 7 of 736 patients in the REGEN-COV 1200-mg group (1.0\%) and in 24 of 748 patients in the placebo group who underwent randomization concurrently (3.2\%) (relative risk reduction, 70.4\%; P\,=\,0.002). The median time to resolution of symptoms was 4 days shorter with each REGEN-COV dose than with placebo (10 days vs. 14 days; P{$<$}0.001 for both comparisons). REGEN-COV was efficacious across various subgroups, including patients who were SARS-CoV-2 serum antibody\textendash positive at baseline. Both REGEN-COV doses reduced viral load faster than placebo; the least-squares mean difference in viral load from baseline through day 7 was -0.71 log10 copies per milliliter (95\% confidence interval [CI], -0.90 to -0.53) in the 1200-mg group and -0.86 log10 copies per milliliter (95\% CI, -1.00 to -0.72) in the 2400-mg group. Serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the placebo group (4.0\%) than in the 1200-mg group (1.1\%) and the 2400-mg group (1.3\%); infusion-related reactions of grade 2 or higher occurred in less than 0.3\% of the patients in all groups. CONCLUSIONS REGEN-COV reduced the risk of Covid-19\textendash related hospitalization or death from any cause, and it resolved symptoms and reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral load more rapidly than placebo.

These policies encourage authors to avoid bar graphs and use graphics that show the data distribution; however, they provide little guidance on how to effectively display data. We conducted a systematic review of studies published in top peripheral vascular disease journals to determine what types of figures are used, and to assess the prevalence of suboptimal data visualization practices. Among papers with data figures, 47.7\% of papers used bar graphs to present continuous data. This primer provides a detailed overview of strategies for addressing this issue by (1) outlining strategies for selecting the correct type of figure depending on the study design, sample size, and the type of variable; (2) examining techniques for making effective dot plots, box plots, and violin plots; and (3) illustrating how to avoid sending mixed messages by aligning the figure structure with the study design and statistical analysis. We also present solutions to other common problems identified in the systematic review. Resources include a list of free tools and templates that authors can use to create more informative figures and an online simulator that illustrates why summary statistics are meaningful only when there are enough data to summarize. Last, we consider steps that investigators can take to improve figures in the scientific literature.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The recommendation of induced hypertension for delayed cerebral ischemia treatment after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage has been challenged recently and ideal pressure targets are missing. A new concept advocates an individual cerebral perfusion pressure where cerebral autoregulation functions best to ensure optimal global perfusion. We characterized optimal cerebral perfusion pressure at time of delayed cerebral ischemia and tested the conformity of induced hypertension with this target value. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING: University hospital neurocritical care unit. PATIENTS: Thirty-nine aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with invasive neuromonitoring (20 with delayed cerebral ischemia, 19 without delayed cerebral ischemia). INTERVENTIONS: Induced hypertension greater than 180\,mm Hg systolic blood pressure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Changepoint analysis was used to calculate significant changes in cerebral perfusion pressure, optimal cerebral perfusion pressure, and the difference of cerebral perfusion pressure and optimal cerebral perfusion pressure 48 hours before delayed cerebral ischemia diagnosis. Optimal cerebral perfusion pressure increased 30 hours before the onset of delayed cerebral ischemia from 82.8 {$\pm$} 12.5 to 86.3 {$\pm$} 11.4\,mm Hg (p {$<$} 0.05). Three hours before delayed cerebral ischemia, a changepoint was also found in the difference of cerebral perfusion pressure and optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (decrease from \textendash 0.2 {$\pm$} 11.2 to \textendash 7.7 {$\pm$} 7.6\,mm Hg; p {$<$} 0.05) with a corresponding increase in pressure reactivity index (0.09 {$\pm$} 0.33 to 0.19 {$\pm$} 0.37; p {$<$} 0.05). Cerebral perfusion pressure at time of delayed cerebral ischemia was lower than in patients without delayed cerebral ischemia in a comparable time frame (cerebral perfusion pressure delayed cerebral ischemia 81.4 {$\pm$} 8.3\,mm Hg, no delayed cerebral ischemia 90.4 {$\pm$} 10.5\,mm Hg; p {$<$} 0.05). Inducing hypertension resulted in a cerebral perfusion pressure above optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (+12.4 {$\pm$} 8.3\,mm Hg; p {$<$} 0.0001). Treatment response (improvement of delayed cerebral ischemia: induced hypertension+ [n = 15] or progression of delayed cerebral ischemia: induced hypertension\textendash{} [n = 5]) did not correlate to either absolute values of cerebral perfusion pressure or optimal cerebral perfusion pressure, nor the resulting difference (cerebral perfusion pressure [p = 0.69]; optimal cerebral perfusion pressure [p = 0.97]; and the difference of cerebral perfusion pressure and optimal cerebral perfusion pressure [p = 0.51]). CONCLUSIONS: At the time of delayed cerebral ischemia occurrence, there is a significant discrepancy between cerebral perfusion pressure and optimal cerebral perfusion pressure with worsening of autoregulation, implying inadequate but identifiable individual perfusion. Standardized induction of hypertension resulted in cerebral perfusion pressures that exceeded individual optimal cerebral perfusion pressure in delayed cerebral ischemia patients.

Since the publication of the original guideline, several authorities have recognized that improvements in the processes of care, ICU structure, and the use of quality improvement science methodologies can beneficially impact patient outcomes and reduce costs. Herein, we summarize findings of the American College of Critical Care Medicine Task Force on Models of Critical Care: 1) An intensivist-led, high-performing, multidisciplinary team dedicated to the ICU is an integral part of effective care delivery; 2) Process improvement is the backbone of achieving high-quality ICU outcomes; 3) Standardized protocols including care bundles and order sets to facilitate measurable processes and outcomes should be used and further developed in the ICU setting; and 4) Institutional support for comprehensive quality improvement programs as well as tele-ICU programs should be provided.}

However, the extent to which they have been externally tested, and how well they generally perform has not been broadly evaluated. Methods: A SCOPUS citation search was run on March 22, 2017 to identify external validations of cardiovascular CPMs in the Tufts Predictive Analytics and Comparative Effectiveness CPM Registry. We assessed the extent of external validation, performance heterogeneity across databases, and explored factors associated with model performance, including a global assessment of the clinical relatedness between the derivation and validation data. Results: We identified 2030 external validations of 1382 CPMs. Eight hundred seven (58\%) of the CPMs in the Registry have never been externally validated. On average, there were 1.5 validations per CPM (range, 0\textendash 94). The median external validation area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.73 (25th\textendash 75th percentile [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.66\textendash 0.79), representing a median percent decrease in discrimination of -11.1\% (IQR, -32.4\% to +2.7\%) compared with performance on derivation data. 81\% (n=1333) of validations reporting area under the receiver operating characteristic curve showed discrimination below that reported in the derivation dataset. 53\% (n=983) of the validations report some measure of CPM calibration. For CPMs evaluated more than once, there was typically a large range of performance. Of 1702 validations classified by relatedness, the percent change in discrimination was -3.7\% (IQR, -13.2 to 3.1) for closely related validations (n=123), -9.0 (IQR, -27.6 to 3.9) for related validations (n=862), and -17.2\% (IQR, -42.3 to 0) for distantly related validations (n=717; P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions: Many published cardiovascular CPMs have never been externally validated, and for those that have, apparent performance during development is often overly optimistic. A single external validation appears insufficient to broadly understand the performance heterogeneity across different settings.},

Practical management includes effective screening, early identification and appropriate treatment aimed at minimising complications and timely escalation decisions.

  abstract = {Rationale. Although misunderstandings about prognosis are common in intensive care units (ICUs), little is known about how physicians actually communicate prognostic information. Objectives. The authors sought to 1) develop a framework to describe the language physicians use to disclose prognosis, 2) determine whether physicians frame prognostic statements as estimates for populations or estimates for individual patients, and 3) determine whether physicians use the recommended ``ask-tell-ask'' approach when discussing prognosis. Methods. The authors conducted a multicenter, cross-sectional study of 51 audiotaped physician-family conferences about life support decisions in ICUs. They identified each prognostic statement and used grounded theory methods to develop a framework to understand the language physicians use to communicate prognosis. Main Results. Physicians prognosticated in 50 of 51 conferences. When discussing prognosis, physicians used qualitative probability statements in 72\% (36/50) of conferences, numeric statements in 20\% (10/50), absolute statements in 13\% (4/32), and nonprobabilistic statements in 40\% (20/50). Physicians exclusively used population-based language in 10\% (5/50) of conferences, single-event probability statements in 62\% (31/50), and both in 28\% (14/ 50). In only 2\% (1/50) of conferences did physicians ask whether the family wished to hear prognostic information prior to discussing it, and in only 14\% of conferences (7/50) did physicians check to verify that families understood the prognostic information. Conclusions. There is considerable variability in the language used by physicians to disclose prognosis, with only 20\% of physicians using quantitative terms. Very few physicians checked whether families understood prognostic information. These findings may provide potential targets for interventions to improve communication about prognosis in ICUs.},

Results of studies on preventative use of melatonin in various patient groups have produced mixed results. The aim of this study was to determine whether administration of melatonin decreases the prevalence of delirium in critically ill patients. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial across 12 Australian ICUs recruiting patients from July 2016 to September 2019. Patients of at least 18 years requiring ICU admission with an expected length of stay (LOS) greater than 72 h; enrolled within 48 h of ICU admission. Indistinguishable liquid melatonin (4 mg; n\,=\,419) or placebo (n\,=\,422) was administered enterally at 21:00 h for 14 consecutive nights or until ICU discharge. The primary outcome was the proportion of delirium-free assessments, as a marker of delirium prevalence, within 14 days or before ICU discharge. Delirium was assessed twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU) score. Secondary outcomes included sleep quality and quantity, hospital and ICU LOS, and hospital and 90-day mortality. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A total of 847 patients were randomized into the study with 841 included in data analysis. Baseline characteristics of the participants were similar. There was no significant difference in the average proportion of delirium-free assessments per patient between the melatonin and placebo groups (79.2 vs 80\% respectively, p\,=\,0.547). There was no significant difference in any secondary outcomes including ICU LOS (median: 5 vs 5 days, p\,=\,0.135), hospital LOS (median: 14 vs 12 days, p\,=\,0816), mortality at any time point including at 90 days (15.5 vs 15.6\% p\,=\,0.948), nor in the quantity or quality of sleep. There were no serious adverse events reported in either group. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Enteral melatonin initiated within 48 h of ICU admission did not reduce the prevalence of delirium compared to placebo. These findings do not support the routine early use of melatonin in the critically ill.},

  abstract = {Coma trajectories are characterized by quick awakening or protracted awakening. Outcome is bookended by restored functionality or permanent cognitively and physically debilitated states. Given the stakes, prognostication cannot be easily questioned as a judgment call, and a scientific underpinning is elemental. Conventional wisdom in determining coma-outcome trajectories posits that (1) predictive models are better than personal experiences, (2) self-fulfilling prophesy is unchecked and driven by nihilism, with little regard for prior probability outcomes, and (3) recovery is impacted by patients' prior wishes and preexisting medical conditions\textemdash but also by what families are told about the patient's state and anticipated clinical course. Moreover, a predicted good outcome can be offset by a major subsequent complication, or a predicted poor outcome can be offset by aggressive care. This article examines some of these concepts, including how we decide on aggressiveness of care, how we judge quality of life, and the impact on outcome. Most patients who awaken quickly do well and can resume their pretrauma injury lives. In worse off, slowto-awaken patients, outcomes are a mixed bag of limited innate resilience, depleted cognitive and physical reserves, and adjusted quality of life. Bias and noise are factors not easily measured in outcome prediction, but their influence on recovery trajectories raises some troubling issues.},

  abstract = {Globally, approximately 70 million people sustain traumatic brain injury each year and this can have significant physical, psychosocial and economic consequences for patients, their families and society. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with a summary of recent studies of direct relevance to the management of traumatic brain injury in order to promote best clinical practice. The use of tranexamic acid in the management of traumatic brain injury has been the focus of several studies, with one large randomised controlled trial suggesting a reduction in all-cause mortality within 24 h of injury. The use of therapeutic hypothermia does not improve neurological outcomes and maintenance of normothermia remains the optimal management strategy. For seizure management, levetiracetam appears to be as effective as phenytoin, but the optimal dose remains unclear. There has been a lack of clear outcome benefit for any individual osmotherapy agent, with no difference in mortality or neurological recovery. Early tracheostomy ({$<$} 7 days from injury) for patients with traumatic brain injury is associated with a reduction in the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and duration of mechanical ventilation, critical care and hospital stay. Further research is needed in order to determine the optimal package of care and interventions. There is a need for research studies to focus on patient-centred outcome measures such as long-term neurological recovery and quality of life.},

  abstract = {Herein, we review mechanisms regulating cerebral blood flow (CBF), with specific focus on humans. We revisit important concepts from the older literature and describe the interaction of various mechanisms of cerebrovascular control. We amalgamate this broad scope of information into a brief review, rather than detailing any one mechanism or area of research. The relationship between regulatory mechanisms is emphasized, but the following three broad categories of control are explicated: (1) the effect of blood gases and neuronal metabolism on CBF; (2) buffering of CBF with changes in blood pressure, termed cerebral autoregulation; and (3) the role of the autonomic nervous system in CBF regulation. With respect to these control mechanisms, we provide evidence against several canonized paradigms of CBF control. Specifically, we corroborate the following four key theses: (1) that cerebral autoregulation does not maintain constant perfusion through a mean arterial pressure range of 60\textendash 150 mmHg; (2) that there is important stimulatory synergism and regulatory interdependence of arterial blood gases and blood pressure on CBF regulation; (3) that cerebral autoregulation and cerebrovascular sensitivity to changes in arterial blood gases are not modulated solely at the pial arterioles; and (4) that neurogenic control of the cerebral vasculature is an important player in autoregulatory function and, crucially, acts to buffer surges in perfusion pressure. Finally, we summarize the state of our knowledge with respect to these areas, outline important gaps in the literature and suggest avenues for future research.},

Many patients fall clearly into a particular category; however, patients may have outcomes that are on the borderline between adjacent categories, and cases can present other challenges for assessment. The Manual includes the general principles of assessment, advice on administering each section of the GOSE interview, and guidance on ``borderline'' and ``difficult'' cases.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: ICU patients/surrogates may experience adverse outcomes related to perceived inappropriate treatment. The objective was to determine the prevalence of patient/surrogatereported perceived inappropriate treatment, its impact on adverse outcomes, and discordance with clinicians. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, observational study of adult ICU patients. RESULTS: For 151 patients, 1,332 patient, surrogate, nurse, and physician surveys were collected. Disagreement between patients/surrogates and clinicians regarding ``too much'' treatment being administered occurred in 26\% of patients. Disagreement regarding ``too little'' treatment occurred in 10\% of patients. Disagreement about perceived inappropriate treatment was associated with prognostic discordance (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .02) and lower patient/surrogate satisfaction (Likert scale 1-5 of 4 vs 5; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .02). Patient/surrogate respondents reported ``too much'' treatment in 8\% of patients and ``too little'' treatment in 6\% of patients. Perceived inappropriate treatment was associated with moderate or high respondent distress for 55\% of patient/surrogate respondents and 35\% of physician/nurse respondents (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .30). Patient/surrogate perception of inappropriate treatment was associated with lower satisfaction (Family Satisfaction in the ICU Questionnaire-24, 69.9 vs 86.6; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .002) and lower trust in the clinical team (Likert scale 1-5 of 4 vs 5; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .007), but no statistically significant differences in depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2 of 2 vs 1; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .06) or anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale of 7 vs 4; P {$\frac{1}{4}$} .18). CONCLUSIONS: For approximately one-third of ICU patients, there is disagreement between clinicians and patients/surrogates about the appropriateness of treatment. Disagreement about appropriateness of treatment was associated with prognostic discordance and lower patient/surrogate satisfaction. Patients/surrogates who reported inappropriate treatment also reported lower satisfaction and trust in the ICU team. CHEST 2019; 155(6):1140-1147},

Objective               To summarize and update the evidence used to inform the systematic development of patient decision aids from the IPDAS Collaboration.                                         Methods               To provide further details about design and development methods, we summarized findings from a subgroup ( n = 283 patient decision aid projects) in a recent systematic review of user involvement by Vaisson et al. Using a new measure of user-centeredness (UCD-11), we then rated the degree of user-centeredness reported in 66 articles describing patient decision aid development and citing the 2013 IPDAS update on systematic development. We contacted the 66 articles' authors to request their self-reports of UCD-11 items.                                         Results               The 283 development processes varied substantially from minimal iteration cycles to more complex processes, with multiple iterations, needs assessments, and extensive involvement of end users. We summarized minimal, medium, and maximal processes from the data. Authors of 54 of 66 articles (82\%) provided self-reported UCD-11 ratings. Self-reported scores were significantly higher than reviewer ratings (reviewers: mean [SD] = 6.45 [3.10]; authors: mean [SD] = 9.62 [1.16], P {$<$} 0.001).                                         Conclusions               Decision aid developers have embraced principles of user-centered design in the development of patient decision aids while also underreporting aspects of user involvement in publications about their tools. Templates may reduce the need for extensive development, and new approaches for rapid development of aids have been proposed when a more detailed approach is not feasible. We provide empirically derived benchmark processes and a reporting checklist to support developers in more fully describing their development processes. [Box: see text]},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to determine the effect of hypothermic temperature control after in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) on mortality and functional outcome as compared with normothermia. METHODS: An investigator initiated, open-label, blinded-outcome-assessor, multicenter, randomized controlled trial comparing hypothermic temperature control (32-34\textdegree C) for 24 h with normothermia after IHCA in 11 hospitals in Germany. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality after 180 days. Secondary end points included in-hospital mortality and favorable functional outcome using the Cerebral Performance Category scale after 180 days. A Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2 was defined as a favorable functional outcome. RESULTS: A total of 1055 patients were screened for eligibility and 249 patients were randomized: 126 were assigned to hypothermic temperature control and 123 to normothermia. The mean age of the cohort was 72.6{$\pm$}10.4 years, 64\% (152 of 236) were male, 73\% (166 of 227) of cardiac arrests were witnessed, 25\% (57 of 231) had an initial shockable rhythm, and time to return of spontaneous circulation was 16.4{$\pm$}10.5 minutes. Target temperature was reached within 4.1 hours after IHCA in the hypothermic group and temperature was controlled for 48 hours at 37.0\textdegree{$\pm$}0.9\textdegree C in the normothermia group. Mortality by day 180 was 72.5\% (87 of 120) in hypothermic temperature control arm, compared with 71.2\% (84 of 118) in the normothermia group (relative risk, 1.03 [95\% CI, 0.79\textendash 1.40]; P=0.822). In-hospital mortality was 62.5\% (75 of 120) in the hypothermic temperature control as compared with 57.6\% (68 of 118) in the normothermia group (relative risk, 1.11 [95\% CI, 0.86\textendash 1.46, P=0.443). Favorable functional outcome (Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2) by day 180 was 22.5\% (27 of 120) in the hypothermic temperature control, compared with 23.7\% (28 of 118) in the normothermia group (relative risk, 1.04 [95\% CI, 0.78\textendash 1.44]; P=0.822). The study was prematurely terminated because of futility. CONCLUSIONS: Hypothermic temperature control as compared with normothermia did not improve survival nor functional outcome at day 180 in patients presenting with coma after IHCA. The HACA-IHCA (Hypothermia After In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest) trial was underpowered and may have failed to detect clinically important differences between hypothermic temperature control and normothermia.

The purpose of this consensus document is to determine those CCUS competencies that should be a mandatory part of training in multidisciplinary intensive care. Methods: A three-round Delphi method followed by face-to-face meeting among 32 CCUS experts nominated by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Agreement of at least 90\% of experts was needed in order to enlist a competency as mandatory. Results: The final list of competencies includes 15 echocardiographic, 5 thoracic, 4 abdominal, deep vein thrombosis diagnosis and central venous access aid. Conclusion: The resulting recommendations offer the most contemporary and evolved set of core CCUS competencies for an intensive care clinician yet described.},

In this Chapter we trace the evolution of Starling's hypothesis to a principle and an equation, and then look in more detail at the extension of the Starling principle in recent years. In 2012 Thomas Woodcock and his son proposed that experience and experimental observations surrounding clinical practices involving the administration of intravenous fluids were better explained by the revised Starling principle. In particular, the revised or extended Starling principle can explain why crystalloid resuscitation from the abrupt physiologic insult of hypovolaemia is much more effective than the pre-revision Starling principle had led clinicians to expect. The authors of this chapter have since combined their science and clinical expertise to offer clinicians a better basis for their practice of rational fluid therapy.},

  abstract = {I.V. fluid therapy does not result in the extracellular volume distribution expected from Starling's original model of semi-permeable capillaries subject to hydrostatic and oncotic pressure gradients within the extracellular fluid. Fluid therapy to support the circulation relies on applying a physiological paradigm that better explains clinical and research observations. The revised Starling equation based on recent research considers the contributions of the endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL), the endothelial basement membrane, and the extracellular matrix. The characteristics of capillaries in various tissues are reviewed and some clinical corollaries considered. The oncotic pressure difference across the EGL opposes, but does not reverse, the filtration rate (the `no absorption' rule) and is an important feature of the revised paradigm and highlights the limitations of attempting to prevent or treat oedema by transfusing colloids. Filtered fluid returns to the circulation as lymph. The EGL excludes larger molecules and occupies a substantial volume of the intravascular space and therefore requires a new interpretation of dilution studies of blood volume and the speculation that protection or restoration of the EGL might be an important therapeutic goal. An explanation for the phenomenon of context sensitivity of fluid volume kinetics is offered, and the proposal that crystalloid resuscitation from low capillary pressures is rational. Any potential advantage of plasma or plasma substitutes over crystalloids for volume expansion only manifests itself at higher capillary pressures.},

Its mortality rate is high, and most survivors experience significant disability.To assess primary patient risk factors associated with mortality and neurologic disability 3 months after ICH in a large, racially and ethnically balanced cohort.This cohort study included participants from the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study, which prospectively recruited 1000 non-Hispanic White, 1000 non-Hispanic Black, and 1000 Hispanic patients with spontaneous ICH to study the epidemiological characteristics and genomics associated with ICH. Participants included those with uniform data collection and phenotype definitions, centralized neuroimaging review, and telephone follow-up at 3 months. Analyses were completed in November 2021.Patient demographic and clinical characteristics as well as hospital event and imaging variables were examined, with characteristics meeting P \&lt; .20 considered candidates for a multivariate model. Elements included in the ICH score were specifically analyzed.Individual characteristics were screened for association with 3-month outcome of neurologic disability or mortality, as assessed by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 4 or greater vs 3 or less under a logistic regression model. A total of 25 characteristics were tested in the final model, which minimized the Akaike information criterion. Analyses were repeated removing individuals who had withdrawal of care.A total of 2568 patients (mean [SD] age, 62.4 [14.7] years; 1069 [41.6\%] women and 1499 [58.4\%] men) had a 3-month outcome determination available, including death. The final logistic model had a significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (C\,=\,0.88) compared with ICH score alone (C\,=\,0.76; P\,\&lt;\,.001). Among characteristics associated with neurologic disability and mortality were larger log ICH volume (OR, 2.74; 95\% CI, 2.36-3.19; P\,\&lt;\,.001), older age (OR per 1-year increase, 1.04; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.05; P\,\&lt;\,.001), pre-ICH mRS score (OR, 1.62; 95\% CI, 1.41-1.87; P\,\&lt;\,.001), lobar location (OR, 0.22; 95\% CI, 0.16-0.30; P\,\&lt;\,.001), and presence of infection (OR, 1.85; 95\% CI, 1.42-2.41; P\,\&lt;\,.001).The findings of this cohort study validate ICH score elements and suggest additional baseline and interim patient characteristics were associated with variation in 3-month outcome.},

Conclusions               Among community-dwelling US adults, three SDOH domains: food insecurity, social isolation, and low educational attainment increase an individual's risk of hospitalization. Additionally, risk of hospitalization increases as SDOH burden increases.},

  abstract = {Overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may contribute to poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.To determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) initiation improves outcomes in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.In an ongoing, adaptive platform randomized clinical trial, 721 critically ill and 58 non\textendash critically ill hospitalized adults were randomized to receive an RAS inhibitor or control between March 16, 2021, and February 25, 2022, at 69 sites in 7 countries (final follow-up on June 1, 2022).Patients were randomized to receive open-label initiation of an ACE inhibitor (n\,=\,257), ARB (n\,=\,248), ARB in combination with DMX-200 (a chemokine receptor-2 inhibitor; n\,=\,10), or no RAS inhibitor (control; n\,=\,264) for up to 10 days.The primary outcome was organ support\textendash free days, a composite of hospital survival and days alive without cardiovascular or respiratory organ support through 21 days. The primary analysis was a bayesian cumulative logistic model. Odds ratios (ORs) greater than 1 represent improved outcomes.On February 25, 2022, enrollment was discontinued due to safety concerns. Among 679 critically ill patients with available primary outcome data, the median age was 56 years and 239 participants (35.2\%) were women. Median (IQR) organ support\textendash free days among critically ill patients was 10 (\textendash 1 to 16) in the ACE inhibitor group (n\,=\,231), 8 (\textendash 1 to 17) in the ARB group (n\,=\,217), and 12 (0 to 17) in the control group (n\,=\,231) (median adjusted odds ratios of 0.77 [95\% bayesian credible interval, 0.58-1.06] for improvement for ACE inhibitor and 0.76 [95\% credible interval, 0.56-1.05] for ARB compared with control). The posterior probabilities that ACE inhibitors and ARBs worsened organ support\textendash free days compared with control were 94.9\% and 95.4\%, respectively. Hospital survival occurred in 166 of 231 critically ill participants (71.9\%) in the ACE inhibitor group, 152 of 217 (70.0\%) in the ARB group, and 182 of 231 (78.8\%) in the control group (posterior probabilities that ACE inhibitor and ARB worsened hospital survival compared with control were 95.3\% and 98.1\%, respectively).In this trial, among critically ill adults with COVID-19, initiation of an ACE inhibitor or ARB did not improve, and likely worsened, clinical outcomes.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02735707},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of multiple interventions for critically ill adults with COVID-19 on longer-term outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prespecified secondary analysis of an ongoing adaptive platform trial (REMAP-CAP) testing interventions within multiple therapeutic domains in which 4869 critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 were enrolled between March 9, 2020, and June 22, 2021, from 197 sites in 14 countries. The final 180-day follow-up was completed on March 2, 2022. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive 1 or more interventions within 6 treatment domains: immune modulators (n = 2274), convalescent plasma (n = 2011), antiplatelet therapy (n = 1557), anticoagulation (n = 1033), antivirals (n = 726), and corticosteroids (n = 401). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was survival through day 180, analyzed using a bayesian piecewise exponential model. A hazard ratio (HR) less than 1 represented improved survival (superiority), while an HR greater than 1 represented worsened survival (harm); futility was represented by a relative improvement less than 20\% in outcome, shown by an HR greater than 0.83. RESULTS Among 4869 randomized patients (mean age, 59.3 years; 1537 [32.1\%] women), 4107 (84.3\%) had known vital status and 2590 (63.1\%) were alive at day 180. IL-6 receptor antagonists had a greater than 99.9\% probability of improving 6-month survival (adjusted HR, 0.74 [95\% credible interval \{CrI\}, 0.61-0.90]) and antiplatelet agents had a 95\% probability of improving 6-month survival (adjusted HR, 0.85 [95\% CrI, 0.71-1.03]) compared with the control, while the probability of trial-defined statistical futility (HR {$>$}0.83) was high for therapeutic anticoagulation (99.9\%; HR, 1.13 [95\% CrI, 0.93-1.42]), convalescent plasma (99.2\%; HR, 0.99 [95\% CrI, 0.86-1.14]), and lopinavir-ritonavir (96.6\%; HR, 1.06 [95\% CrI, 0.82-1.38]) and the probabilities of harm from hydroxychloroquine (96.9\%; HR, 1.51 [95\% CrI, 0.98-2.29]) and the combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine (96.8\%; HR, 1.61 [95\% CrI, 0.97-2.67]) were high. The corticosteroid domain was stopped early prior to reaching a predefined statistical trigger; there was a 57.1\% to 61.6\% probability of improving 6-month survival across varying hydrocortisone dosing strategies. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among critically ill patients with COVID-19 randomized to receive 1 or more therapeutic interventions, treatment with an IL-6 receptor antagonist had a greater than 99.9\% probability of improved 180-day mortality compared with patients randomized to the control, and treatment with an antiplatelet had a 95.0\% probability of improved 180-day mortality compared with patients randomized to the control. Overall, when considered with previously reported short-term results, the findings indicate that initial in-hospital treatment effects were consistent for most therapies through 6 months.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Ketamine is increasingly being used for analgosedation, but its effect on delirium remains unclear. We compared delirium risk variables and ketamine analgosedation use between adults who developed incident delirium and those who did not, evaluated whether ketamine analgosedation increases delirium risk, and compared ICU delirium characteristics, treatments, and outcomes between ketamine and nonketamine patients with delirium. DESIGN: Secondary, subgroup analysis of a cohort study. SETTING: Single, 36-bed mixed medical-surgical ICU in the Netherlands from July 2016 to February 2020. PATIENTS: Consecutive adults were included. Patients admitted after elective surgery, not expected to survive greater than or equal to 48 hours, admitted with delirium, or where delirium occurred prior to ketamine use were excluded. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Trained ICU nurses evaluated patients without coma (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale. \textendash 4/\textendash 5) every 8 hours with the Confusion Assessment Method ICU; a delirium day was defined by greater than or equal to1 + Confusion Assessment Method ICU and/or scheduled antipsychotic use. Among 11 variables compared between the delirium and nondelirium groups (Baseline: age, Charlson Comorbidity score, cognitive impairment, admission type, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-IV score, daily ICU [until delirium occurrence or discharge]: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, coma, benzodiazepine, opioid, and ketamine use) and total ICU days, 7 (age, Charlson score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, coma, benzodiazepine, opioid, and ketamine use) were significantly different and were entered, along with delirium occurrence, in a logistic regression model. A total of 332 of 925 of patients (36\%) developed delirium. Ketamine use was greater in patients with delirium (54 [16\%] vs 4 [0.7\%]; p {$<$} 0.01). Ketamine use (adjusted odds ratio, 5.60; 95\% CI, 1.09\textendash 29.15), age (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03; 95\% CI, 1.01\textendash 1.06), coma (adjusted odds ratio, 2.10; 95\% CI, 1.15\textendash 3.78), opioid use (adjusted odds ratio, 171.17; 95\% CI, 66.45\textendash 553.68), and benzodiazepine use (adjusted odds ratio, 34.07; 95\% CI, 8.12\textendash 235.34) were each independently and significantly associated with increased delirium. Delirium duration, motoric subtype, delirium treatments, and outcomes were not different between the ketamine and nonketamine groups. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine analgosedation may contribute to increased ICU delirium. The characteristics of ketamine and nonketamine delirium are similar. Further prospective research is required to evaluate the magnitude of risk for delirium with ketamine use.},

  abstract = {Background:               A small randomized controlled trial suggested that dabigatran may be as effective as warfarin in the treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). We aimed to compare direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to warfarin in a real-world CVT cohort.                                         Methods:               This multicenter international retrospective study (United States, Europe, New Zealand) included consecutive patients with CVT treated with oral anticoagulation from January 2015 to December 2020. We abstracted demographics and CVT risk factors, hypercoagulable labs, baseline imaging data, and clinical and radiological outcomes from medical records. We used adjusted inverse probability of treatment weighted Cox-regression models to compare recurrent cerebral or systemic venous thrombosis, death, and major hemorrhage in patients treated with warfarin versus DOACs. We performed adjusted inverse probability of treatment weighted logistic regression to compare recanalization rates on follow-up imaging across the 2 treatments groups.                                         Results:                                Among 1025 CVT patients across 27 centers, 845 patients met our inclusion criteria. Mean age was 44.8 years, 64.7\% were women; 33.0\% received DOAC only, 51.8\% received warfarin only, and 15.1\% received both treatments at different times. During a median follow-up of 345 (interquartile range, 140\textendash 720) days, there were 5.68 recurrent venous thrombosis, 3.77 major hemorrhages, and 1.84 deaths per 100 patient-years. Among 525 patients who met recanalization analysis inclusion criteria, 36.6\% had complete, 48.2\% had partial, and 15.2\% had no recanalization. When compared with warfarin, DOAC treatment was associated with similar risk of recurrent venous thrombosis (aHR, 0.94 [95\% CI, 0.51\textendash 1.73];                 P                 =0.84), death (aHR, 0.78 [95\% CI, 0.22\textendash 2.76];                 P                 =0.70), and rate of partial/complete recanalization (aOR, 0.92 [95\% CI, 0.48\textendash 1.73];                 P                 =0.79), but a lower risk of major hemorrhage (aHR, 0.35 [95\% CI, 0.15\textendash 0.82];                 P                 =0.02).                                                        Conclusions:               In patients with CVT, treatment with DOACs was associated with similar clinical and radiographic outcomes and favorable safety profile when compared with warfarin treatment. Our findings need confirmation by large prospective or randomized studies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine whether targeted temperature management (TTM) modifies the adverse association between increasing prehospital epinephrine dose and neurologically favorable survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study assessed 14 612 adults from Seattle and King County, Washington, with nontraumatic OHCA between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018, and included those who achieved return of spontaneous circulation and were unconscious at hospital admission. Data analysis was performed from April 2021 to May 2022. EXPOSURES Epinephrine dose and TTM during prehospital resuscitation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Favorable neurologic survival (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] 1 or 2) and survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS Of the 14 612 assessed adults, 5253 (median age, 63 years; IQR, 51-74 years; 3460 [65.8\%] male) were eligible for the study. The median epinephrine dose was 2.0 mg (IQR, 1.0-3.0 mg); 3052 patients (58.1\%) received TTM. In all, 1889 patients (36.0\%) survived with CPC 1 to 2, and 2177 (41.4\%) survived to discharge. Increasing doses of epinephrine were associated with a decreasing likelihood of CPC 1 to 2 (odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95\% CI 0.42-0.50 for each additional milligram of epinephrine) and survival (OR, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.43-0.51). The dose-dependent epinephrine association was modified by TTM. After adjusting for Utstein covariates, TTM was associated with a relative stepwise improvement in odds of CPC 1 to 2 (interaction OR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.22-1.51) and survival (interaction OR, 1.37; 95\% CI, 1.24-1.51). A significant interaction was also observed when the analysis was stratified according to initial rhythm among shockable OHCA and nonshockable OHCA (shockable interaction OR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.39; and nonshockable interaction OR, 1.24, 95\% CI, 1.07-1.45). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cohort study found an interaction between TTM and epinephrine dose such that the beneficial association of TTM increased with increasing epinephrine dose, suggesting that TTM may attenuate the adverse effects of higher-dose epinephrine.},

  abstract = {Administration of corticosteroids to patients affected by influenza virus, especially pandemic avian influenza virus, although relatively common, remains controversial. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the impact of corticosteroid treatment on outcomes of patients with influenza virus infection. The PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to February, 2015. Studies comparing corticosteroid treatment with no corticosteroid treatment in patients with influenza virus infection were included. The primary outcomes assessed were the association of mortality and nosocomial infection with corticosteroid treatment. Two authors independently extracted the data. ORs and weighted mean differences (WMDs) were used to describe dichotomous data and continuous data, respectively. Nineteen studies with 4916 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that corticosteroid treatment was significantly associated with mortality (OR 1.98, 95\% CI 1.62-2.43, p {$<$} 0.00001) and nosocomial infection (OR 3.16, 95\% CI 2.09-4.78, p {$<$} 0.00001). The durations of mechanical ventilation (WMD 3.82, 95\% CI 1.49-6.15, p 0.001) and intensive-care unit stay (WMD 4.78, 95\% CI 2.27-7.29, p 0.0002) were both markedly longer in the corticosteroid treatment group than in the control group. These findings suggest that routine steroid use may not be ideal for influenza virus infection. However, these results are derived from observational studies, with some important biases. They should be examined in future sufficiently powered randomized trials.},

  abstract = {Background The optimum systolic blood pressure after endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke is uncertain. We aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of blood pressure lowering treatment according to more intensive versus less intensive treatment targets in patients with elevated blood pressure after reperfusion with endovascular treatment. Methods We conducted an open-label, blinded-endpoint, randomised controlled trial at 44 tertiary-level hospitals in China. Eligible patients (aged {$\geq$}18 years) had persistently elevated systolic blood pressure ({$\geq$}140 mm Hg for {$>$}10 min) following successful reperfusion with endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke from any intracranial large-vessel occlusion. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1, by a central, web-based program with a minimisation algorithm) to more intensive treatment (systolic blood pressure target {$<$}120 mm Hg) or less intensive treatment (target 140\textendash 180 mm Hg) to be achieved within 1 h and sustained for 72 h. The primary efficacy outcome was functional recovery, assessed according to the distribution in scores on the modified Rankin scale (range 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. Analyses were done according to the modified intention-to-treat principle. Efficacy analyses were performed with proportional odds logistic regression with adjustment for treatment allocation as a fixed effect, site as a random effect, and baseline prognostic factors, and included all randomly assigned patients who provided consent and had available data for the primary outcome. The safety analysis included all randomly assigned patients. The treatment effects were expressed as odds ratios (ORs). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04140110, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, 1900027785; recruitment has stopped at all participating centres. Findings Between July 20, 2020, and March 7, 2022, 821 patients were randomly assigned. The trial was stopped after review of the outcome data on June 22, 2022, due to persistent efficacy and safety concerns. 407 participants were assigned to the more intensive treatment group and 409 to the less intensive treatment group, of whom 404 patients in the more intensive treatment group and 406 patients in the less intensive treatment group had primary outcome data available. The likelihood of poor functional outcome was greater in the more intensive treatment group than the less intensive treatment group (common OR 1{$\cdot$}37 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}07\textendash 1{$\cdot$}76]). Compared with the less intensive treatment group, the more intensive treatment group had more early neurological deterioration (common OR 1{$\cdot$}53 [95\% 1{$\cdot$}18\textendash 1{$\cdot$}97]) and major disability at 90 days (OR 2{$\cdot$}07 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}47\textendash 2{$\cdot$}93]) but there were no significant differences in symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. There were no significant differences in serious adverse events or mortality between groups. Interpretation Intensive control of systolic blood pressure to lower than 120 mm Hg should be avoided to prevent compromising the functional recovery of patients who have received endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusion.

We assessed the effects of the influenza vaccine on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library through January 2020 for randomized controlled trials and observational studies assessing the effects of influenza vaccine on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Estimates were reported as random effects risk ratios (RRs) with 95\% CIs. Analyses were stratified by study design into randomized controlled trials and observational studies. A total of 16 studies (n=237 058), including 4 randomized controlled trials (n=1667) and 12 observational studies (n=235 391), were identified. Participants' mean age was 69.2{$\pm$}7.01 years, 36.6\% were women, 65.1\% had hypertension, 31.1\% had diabetes mellitus, and 23.4\% were smokers. At a median follow-\-up duration of 19.5 months, influenza vaccine was associated with a lower risk of all-\-cause mortality (RR, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.60\textendash\-0.93 [P=0.01]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.80\textendash\-0.84 [P{$<$}0.001]), and major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.80\textendash\-0.94 [P{$<$}0.001]) compared with control. The use of the influenza vaccine was not associated with a statistically significant reduction of myocardial infarction (RR, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.49\textendash\-1.09 [P=0.12]) compared with control. CONCLUSIONS: Data from both randomized controlled trials and observational studies support the use of the influenza vaccine in adults with cardiovascular disease to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events, as currently supported by clinical guidelines. Clinicians and health systems should continue to promote the influenza vaccine as part of comprehensive secondary prevention.},

Setting Private or commercial aircraft between September 2017 and August 2018. Participants 92 aircraft passengers aged 18 and over were screened for participation. 23 agreed to be enrolled and were randomized. Intervention Jumping from an aircraft (airplane or helicopter) with a parachute versus an empty backpack (unblinded). Main outcome measures Composite of death or major traumatic injury (defined by an Injury Severity Score over 15) upon impact with the ground measured immediately after landing. Results Parachute use did not significantly reduce death or major injury (0\% for parachute v 0\% for control; P{$>$}0.9). This finding was consistent across multiple subgroups. Compared with individuals screened but not enrolled, participants included in the study were on aircraft at significantly lower altitude (mean of 0.6 m for participants v mean of 9146 m for non-participants; P{$<$}0.001) and lower velocity (mean of 0 km/h v mean of 800 km/h; P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions Parachute use did not reduce death or major traumatic injury when jumping from aircraft in the first randomized evaluation of this intervention. However, the trial was only able to enroll participants on small stationary aircraft on the ground, suggesting cautious extrapolation to high altitude jumps. When beliefs regarding the effectiveness of an intervention exist in the community, randomized trials might selectively enroll individuals with a lower perceived likelihood of benefit, thus diminishing the applicability of the results to clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Objective Hematoma expansion (HE) is commonly analyzed as a dichotomous outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) trials. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose an HE shift analysis model as a method to improve the evaluation of candidate ICH therapies. Methods Using data from the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH2) trial, we performed HE shift analysis in response to intensive blood pressure lowering by generating polychotomous strata based on previously established HE definitions, percentile/ absolute quartiles of hematoma volume change, and quartiles of 24-hour follow-up hematoma volumes. The relationship between blood pressure treatment and HE shift was explored with proportional odds models. Results The primary analysis population included 863 patients. In both treatment groups, approximately one-third of patients exhibited no HE. With the use of a trichotomous HE stratification, the highest strata of {$\geq$}33\% revealed a 5.8\% reduction in hematoma growth for those randomized to intensive therapy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.77, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.60\textendash 0.99). Using percentile quartiles of hematoma volume change, we observed a favorable shift to reduce growth in patients treated with intensive therapy (aOR 0.73, 95\% CI 0.57\textendash 0.93). Similarly, in a tetrachotomous analysis of 24-hour follow-up hematoma volumes, shifts in the highest stratum ({$>$}21.9 mL) were most notable. Conclusions Our findings suggest that intensive blood pressure reduction may preferentially mitigate growth in patients at risk of high volume HE. A shift analysis model of HE provides additional insights into the biological effects of a given therapy and may be an additional way to assess hemostatic agents in future studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trauma teams are often faced with patients on antithrombotic (AT) drugs, which is challenging when bleeding occurs. We sought to compare the effects of different AT medications on head injury severity and hypothesized that AT reversal would not improve mortality in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. METHODS: An Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma\textendash sponsored prospective, multicentered, observational study of 15 trauma centers was performed. Patient demographics, injury burden, comorbidities, AT agents, and reversal attempts were collected. Outcomes of interest were head injury severity and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Analysis was performed on 2,793 patients. The majority of patients were on aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], 46.1\%). Patients on a platelet chemoreceptor blocker (P2Y12) had the highest mean Injury Severity Score (9.1 {$\pm$} 8.1). Patients taking P2Y12 inhibitors {$\pm$} ASA, and ASA-warfarin had the highest head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) mean (1.2 {$\pm$} 1.6). On risk-adjusted analysis, warfarin-ASA was associated with a higher head AIS (odds ratio [OR], 2.43; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.34\textendash 4.42) after controlling for Injury Severity Score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, and initial systolic blood pressure. Among patients with severe TBI (head AIS score, {$\geq$}3) on antiplatelet therapy, reversal with desmopressin (DDAVP) and/or platelet transfusion did not improve survival (82.9\% reversal vs. 90.4\% none, p = 0.30). In severe TBI patients taking Xa inhibitors who received prothrombin complex concentrate, survival was not improved (84.6\% reversal vs. 84.6\% none, p = 0.68).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke is generally avoided when the infarction is large, but the effect of endovascular therapy with medical care as compared with medical care alone for large strokes has not been well studied. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial in Japan involving patients with occlusion of large cerebral vessels and sizable strokes on imaging, as indicated by an Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomographic Score (ASPECTS) value of 3 to 5 (on a scale from 0 to 10, with lower values indicating larger infarction). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive endovascular therapy with medical care or medical care alone within 6 hours after they were last known to be well or within 24 hours if there was no early change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Alteplase (0.6 mg per kilogram of body weight) was used when appropriate in both groups. The primary outcome was a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 3 (on a scale from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included a shift across the range of modified Rankin scale scores toward a better outcome at 90 days and an improvement of at least 8 points in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (range, 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating greater deficit) at 48 hours.

This article was published on February 9, 2022, at NEJM.org. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2118191 Copyright \textcopyright{} 2022 Massachusetts Medical Society. RESULTS A total of 203 patients underwent randomization; 101 patients were assigned to the endovascular-therapy group and 102 to the medical-care group. Approximately 27\% of patients in each group received alteplase. The percentage of patients with a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 3 at 90 days was 31.0\% in the endovasculartherapy group and 12.7\% in the medical-care group (relative risk, 2.43; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.35 to 4.37; P\,=\,0.002). The ordinal shift across the range of modified Rankin scale scores generally favored endovascular therapy. An improvement of at least 8 points on the NIHSS score at 48 hours was observed in 31.0\% of the patients in the endovascular-therapy group and 8.8\% of those in the medical-care group (relative risk, 3.51; 95\% CI, 1.76 to 7.00), and any intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 58.0\% and 31.4\%, respectively (P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS In a trial conducted in Japan, patients with large cerebral infarctions had better functional outcomes with endovascular therapy than with medical care alone but had more intracranial hemorrhages.

  abstract = {Saline (0.9\% sodium chloride) is the most commonly administered intravenous fluid; however, its use may be associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) and increased mortality.To determine the effect of a buffered crystalloid compared with saline on renal complications in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).Double-blind, cluster randomized, double-crossover trial conducted in 4 ICUs in New Zealand from April 2014 through October 2014. Three ICUs were general medical and surgical ICUs; 1 ICU had a predominance of cardiothoracic and vascular surgical patients.All patients admitted to the ICU requiring crystalloid fluid therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients with established AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) were excluded. All 2278 eligible patients were enrolled; 1152 of 1162 patients (99.1\%)  receiving buffered crystalloid and 1110 of 1116 patients (99.5\%) receiving saline were analyzed.Participating ICUs were assigned a masked study fluid, either saline or a buffered crystalloid, for alternating 7-week treatment blocks. Two ICUs commenced using 1 fluid and the other 2 commenced using the alternative fluid. Two crossovers occurred so that each ICU used each fluid twice over the 28 weeks of the study. The treating clinician determined the rate and frequency of fluid administration.The primary outcome was proportion of patients with AKI (defined as a rise in serum creatinine level of at least 2-fold or a serum creatinine level of  {$\geq$}3.96 mg/dL with an increase of {$\geq$}0.5 mg/dL); main secondary outcomes were incidence of RRT use and in-hospital mortality.In the buffered crystalloid group, 102 of 1067 patients (9.6\%) developed AKI within 90 days after enrollment compared with 94 of 1025 patients (9.2\%) in the saline group (absolute difference, 0.4\% [95\% CI, -2.1\% to 2.9\%]; relative risk [RR], 1.04 [95\% CI, 0.80 to 1.36]; P\,=\,.77). In the buffered crystalloid group, RRT was used in 38 of 1152 patients (3.3\%) compared with 38 of 1110 patients (3.4\%) in the saline group (absolute difference, -0.1\% [95\% CI, -1.6\% to 1.4\%]; RR, 0.96 [95\% CI, 0.62 to 1.50]; P\,=\,.91). Overall, 87 of 1152 patients (7.6\%) in the buffered crystalloid group and 95 of 1110 patients (8.6\%) in the saline group died in the hospital (absolute difference, -1.0\% [95\% CI, -3.3\% to 1.2\%]; RR, 0.88 [95\% CI, 0.67 to 1.17]; P\,=\,.40).Among patients receiving crystalloid fluid therapy in the ICU, use of a buffered crystalloid compared with saline did not reduce the risk of AKI. Further large randomized clinical trials are needed to assess efficacy in higher-risk populations and to measure clinical outcomes such as mortality.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: ACTRN12613001370796},

In our Viewpoint, we sought to provide a framework for them to do this in situations in which actionable findings might be hidden behind a non\textendash statistically significant primary outcome. We agree with Dr Piovani and colleagues that when deciding whether to implement clinical trial findings, outcomes that matter to patients are the most important. However, because data pertaining to all potentially important outcomes are often not available, clinicians must make decisions about evidence under conditions of uncertainty. We consider that they should do so based on an assessment of the probability that a particular treatment will result in a net benefit for a patient, focusing first on outcomes that are likely to matter to patients.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Neuroethical questions raised by recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of consciousness are rapidly expanding, increasingly relevant, and yet underexplored. The aim of this thematic review is to provide a clinically applicable framework for understanding the current taxonomy of disorders of consciousness and to propose an approach to identifying and critically evaluating actionable neuroethical issues that are frequently encountered in research and clinical care for this vulnerable population. Increased awareness of these issues and clarity about opportunities for optimizing ethically-responsible care in this domain are especially timely given recent surges in critically ill patients with unusually prolonged disorders of consciousness associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) around the world. We begin with an overview of the field of neuroethics: what it is, its history and evolution in the context of biomedical ethics at large. We then explore nomenclature used in disorders of consciousness, covering categories proposed by the American Academy of Neurology, the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine, and the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research, including definitions of terms such as coma, the vegetative state, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, minimally conscious state, covert consciousness, and the confusional state. We discuss why these definitions matter, and why there has been such evolution in this nosology over the years, from Jennett and Plum in 1972 to the Multi-Society Task Force in 1994, the Aspen Working Group in 2002 and up until the 2018 American and 2020 European Disorders of Consciousness guidelines. We then move to a discussion of clinical aspects of disorders of consciousness, the natural history of recovery, and ethical issues that arise within the context of caring for persons with disorders of consciousness. We conclude with a discussion of key challenges associated with assessing residual consciousness in disorders of consciousness, potential solutions and future directions, including integration of crucial disability rights perspectives.},

  abstract = {Nearly all patients receiving treatment in a peri-operative or intensive care setting receive supplemental oxygen therapy. It is biologically plausible that the dose of oxygen used might affect important patient outcomes. Most peri-operative research has focussed on oxygen regimens that target higher than normal blood oxygen levels. Whereas, intensive care research has mostly focussed on conservative oxygen regimens which assiduously avoid exposure to higher than normal blood oxygen levels. While such conservative oxygen therapy is preferred for spontaneously breathing patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the optimal oxygen regimen in other patient groups is not clear. Some data suggest that conservative oxygen therapy might be preferred for patients with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. However, unless oxygen supplies are constrained, routinely aggressively down-titrating oxygen in either the peri-operative or intensive care setting is not necessary based on available data. Targeting higher than normal levels of oxygen might reduce surgical site infections in the perioperative setting and/or improve outcomes for intensive care patients with sepsis but further research is required and available data are not sufficiently strong to warrant routine implementation of such oxygen strategies.},

Reporting standards adopted by JAMA and other leading journals lead to relative uniformity of presentation of RCT findings that help simplify critical appraisal. Such uniform reporting also means that the conclusion of the trial may be dichotomized as ``positive'' or ``no difference'' based on the statistical significance of the primary outcome. Dichotomization based on the statistical significance of the primary outcome variable reflects the correct, albeit narrow, interpretation of the experiment that the RCT represents. It also reflects decisions made by the investigators in the design of the study and highlights findings in relation to prespecified assumptions. However, there are situations in which a broader appreciation of the results may suggest that non\textendash statistically significant results in the primary outcome of a clinical trial could influence and perhaps change practice.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To identify pathological CT features associated with adverse outcomes after mTBI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The longitudinal, observational Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study enrolled patients with TBI, including those 17 years and older with GCS scores of 13 to 15 who presented to emergency departments at 18 US level 1 trauma centers between February 26, 2014, and August 8, 2018, and underwent head CT imaging within 24 hours of TBI. Evaluations of CT imaging used TBI Common Data Elements. Glasgow Outcome Scale\textendash Extended (GOSE) scores were assessed at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. External validation of results was performed via the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study. Data analyses were completed from February 2020 to February 2021. EXPOSURES Acute nonpenetrating head trauma. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Frequency, co-occurrence, and clustering of CT features; incomplete recovery (GOSE scores {$<$}8 vs 8); and an unfavorable outcome (GOSE scores {$<$}5 vs Ն5) at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS In 1935 patients with mTBI (mean [SD] age, 41.5 [17.6] years; 1286 men [66.5\%]) in the TRACK-TBI cohort and 2594 patients with mTBI (mean [SD] age, 51.8 [20.3] years; 1658 men [63.9\%]) in an external validation cohort, hierarchical cluster analysis identified 3 major clusters of CT features: contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and/or subdural hematoma; intraventricular and/or petechial hemorrhage; and epidural hematoma. Contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and/or subdural hematoma features were associated with incomplete recovery (odds ratios [ORs] for GOSE scores {$<$}8 at 1 year: TRACK-TBI, 1.80 [95\% CI, 1.39-2.33]; CENTER-TBI, 2.73 [95\% CI, 2.18-3.41]) and greater degrees of unfavorable outcomes (ORs for GOSE scores {$<$}5 at 1 year: TRACK-TBI, 3.23 [95\% CI, 1.59-6.58]; CENTER-TBI, 1.68 [95\% CI, 1.13-2.49]) out to 12 months after injury, but epidural hematoma was not. Intraventricular and/or petechial hemorrhage was associated with greater degrees of unfavorable outcomes up to 12 months after injury (eg, OR for GOSE scores {$<$}5 at 1 year in TRACK-TBI: 3.47 [95\% CI, 1.66-7.26]). Some CT features were more strongly associated with outcomes than previously validated variables (eg, ORs for GOSE scores {$<$}5 at 1 year in TRACK-TBI: neuropsychiatric history, 1.43 [95\% CI .98-2.10] vs contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and/or subdural hematoma, 3.23 [95\% CI 1.59-6.58]). Findings were externally validated in 2594 patients with mTBI enrolled in the CENTER-TBI study. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, pathological CT features carried different prognostic implications after mTBI to 1 year postinjury. Some patterns of injury were associated with worse outcomes than others. These results support that patients with mTBI and these CT features need TBI-specific education and systematic follow-up.},

  abstract = {Administration of traditional chloride-liberal intravenous fluids may precipitate acute kidney injury (AKI).To assess the association of a chloride-restrictive (vs chloride-liberal) intravenous fluid strategy with AKI in critically ill patients.Prospective, open-label, sequential period pilot study of 760 patients admitted consecutively to the intensive care unit (ICU) during the control period (February 18 to August 17, 2008) compared with 773 patients admitted consecutively during the intervention period (February 18 to August 17, 2009) at a university-affiliated hospital in Melbourne, Australia.During the control period, patients received standard intravenous fluids. After a 6-month phase-out period (August 18, 2008, to February 17, 2009), any use of chloride-rich intravenous fluids (0.9\% saline, 4\% succinylated gelatin solution, or 4\% albumin solution) was restricted to attending specialist approval only during the intervention period; patients instead received a lactated solution (Hartmann solution), a balanced solution (Plasma-Lyte 148), and chloride-poor 20\% albumin.The primary outcomes included increase from baseline to peak creatinine level in the ICU and incidence of AKI according to the risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage (RIFLE) classification. Secondary post hoc analysis outcomes included the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), length of stay in ICU and hospital, and survival.Chloride administration decreased by 144~504 mmol (from 694 to 496 mmol/patient) from the control period to the intervention period. Comparing the control period with the intervention period, the mean serum creatinine level increase while in the ICU was 22.6 {$\mu$}mol/L (95\% CI, 17.5-27.7 {$\mu$}mol/L) vs 14.8 {$\mu$}mol/L (95\% CI, 9.8-19.9 {$\mu$}mol/L) (P~=~.03), the incidence of injury and failure class of RIFLE-defined AKI was 14\% (95\% CI, 11\%-16\%; n~=~105) vs 8.4\% (95\% CI, 6.4\%-10\%; n~=~65) (P \&lt;.001), and the use of RRT was 10\% (95\% CI, 8.1\%-12\%; n~=~78) vs 6.3\% (95\% CI, 4.6\%-8.1\%; n~=~49) (P~=~.005). After adjustment for covariates, this association remained for incidence of injury and failure class of RIFLE-defined AKI (odds ratio, 0.52 [95\% CI, 0.37-0.75]; P \&lt;.001) and use of RRT (odds ratio, 0.52 [95\% CI, 0.33-0.81]; P~=~.004). There were no differences in hospital mortality, hospital or ICU length of stay, or need for RRT after hospital discharge.The implementation of a chloride-restrictive strategy in a tertiary ICU was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of AKI and use of RRT.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00885404},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) with electroencephalographic epileptiform activity (seizures, periodic and rhythmic patterns, and sporadic discharges) are frequently treated with antiseizure medications (ASMs). However, the safety and effectiveness of ASM treatment for epileptiform activity has not been established. We used observational data to investigate the effectiveness of ASM treatment in patients with aSAH undergoing continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) to develop a causal hypothesis for testing in prospective trials. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} This was a retrospective single-center cohort study of patients with aSAH admitted between 2011 and 2016. Patients underwent\,{$\geq$}\,24 h of cEEG within 4 days of admission. All patients received primary ASM prophylaxis until aneurysm treatment (typically within 24 h of admission). Treatment exposure was defined as reinitiation of ASMs after aneurysm treatment and cEEG initiation. We excluded patients with non-cEEG indications for ASMs (e.g., epilepsy, acute symptomatic seizures). Outcomes measures were 90-day mortality and good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale scores 0\textendash 3). Propensity scores were used to adjust for baseline covariates and disease severity. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Ninety-four patients were eligible (40 continued ASM treatment; 54 received prophylaxis only). ASM continuation was not significantly associated with higher 90-day mortality (propensity-adjusted hazard ratio [HR]\,=\,2.01 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.57\textendash 7.02]). ASM continuation was associated with lower likelihood for 90-day good functional outcome (propensity-adjusted HR\,=\,0.39 [95\% CI 0.18\textendash 0.81]). In a secondary analysis, low-intensity treatment (low-dose single ASM) was not significantly associated with mortality (propensity-adjusted HR\,=\,0.60 [95\% CI 0.10\textendash 3.59]), although it was associated with a lower likelihood of good outcome (propensity-adjusted HR\,=\,0.37 [95\% CI 0.15\textendash 0.91]), compared with prophylaxis. High-intensity treatment (high-dose single ASM, multiple ASMs, or anesthetics) was associated with higher mortality (propensity-adjusted HR\,=\,6.80 [95\% CI 1.67\textendash 27.65]) and lower likelihood for good outcomes (propensity-adjusted HR\,=\,0.30 [95\% CI 0.10\textendash 0.94]) compared with prophylaxis only.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess physician prognosis and treatment recommendations for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and to determine the effect of providing physicians a validated prognostic score. METHODS: A written survey with 2 ICH scenarios was completed by practicing neurologists and neurosurgeons. Selected factors were randomly varied (patient older vs middle age, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 7T vs 11, and presence vs absence of a validated prognostic score). Outcomes included predicted 30-day mortality and recommendations for initial treatment intensity (6-point scale ranging from 1 = comfort only to 6 = full treatment). RESULTS: A total of 742 physicians were included (mean age 52, 32\% neurosurgeons, 17\% female). Physician predictions of 30-day mortality varied widely (mean [range] for the 4 possible combinations of age and GCS were 23\% [0\%-80\%], 35\% [0\%-100\%], 48\% [0\%-100\%], and 58\% [5\%-100\%]). Treatment recommendations also varied widely, with responses encompassing the full range of response options for each case. No physician demographic or personality characteristics were associated with treatment recommendations. Providing a prognostic score changed treatment recommendations, and the effect differed across cases. When the prognostic score suggested 0\% chance of functional independence (76-year-old with GCS 7T), the likelihood of treatment limitations was increased (odds ratio [OR] 1.61, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.33) compared to no prognostic score. Conversely, if the score suggested a 66\% chance of independence (63-year-old with GCS 11), treatment limitations were less likely (OR 0.62, 95\% CI 0.43-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians vary substantially in ICH prognostic estimates and treatment recommendations. This variability could have a profound effect on life and death decision-making and treatment for ICH.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To assess whether results of a randomized controlled trial could be affected by fluid use before enrollment and admission type. Methods: Secondary post-hoc analysis of the Balanced Solution in Intensive Care (BaSICS) trial, which compared a balanced solution (Plasma-Lyte 148) to 0.9\% saline in intensive care unit. Patients were categorized according to fluid use in the 24 hours before enrollment in four groups: balanced solutions only; 0.9\% saline only; mix of both, and no fluid before enrollment, and according to admission type (planned, unplanned with sepsis and unplanned without sepsis). The association between 90-day mortality and the randomization group was assessed using an hierarchical logistic Bayesian model. Measurements and Main Results: 10,520 patients were included. There was a low probability that the balanced solution was associated with improved 90-day mortality in the whole trial population (odds ratio, 0.95; 89\% credible intervals [CrI], 0.66-1.51; probability of benefit, 0.58); however, probability of benefit was high for patients that received only balanced solutions before enrollment (regardless of admission type, odds ratio, 0.78, 89\% CrI, 0.56,1.03; probability of benefit, 0.92), mostly due to a benefit in unplanned admissions due to sepsis (odd ratio, 0.70; 89\% CrI, 0.50-0.97; probability of benefit, 0.96) and planned admissions (odds ratio, 0.79; 89\% CrI, 0.65-0.97; 0.97 probability of benefit, 0.97). Conclusion: There is a high probability that balanced solution use in the ICU reduces 90-day mortality in patients that exclusively received balanced fluids before trial enrollment.},

  abstract = {Timing of initiation of kidney-replacement therapy (KRT) in critically ill patients remains controversial. The Standard versus Accelerated Initiation of Renal-Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney Injury (STARRT-AKI) trial compared two strategies of KRT initiation (accelerated versus standard) in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and found neutral results for 90-day all-cause mortality. Probabilistic exploration of the trial endpoints may enable greater understanding of the trial findings. We aimed to perform a reanalysis using a Bayesian framework. We performed a secondary analysis of all 2927 patients randomized in multi-national STARRT-AKI trial, performed at 168 centers in 15 countries. The primary endpoint, 90-day all-cause mortality, was evaluated using hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression. A spectrum of priors includes optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic priors, along with priors informed from earlier clinical trials. Secondary endpoints (KRT-free days and hospital-free days) were assessed using zero\textendash one inflated beta regression. The posterior probability of benefit comparing an accelerated versus a standard KRT initiation strategy for the primary endpoint suggested no important difference, regardless of the prior used (absolute difference of 0.13\% [95\% credible interval [CrI] - 3.30\%; 3.40\%], - 0.39\% [95\% CrI - 3.46\%; 3.00\%], and 0.64\% [95\% CrI - 2.53\%; 3.88\%] for neutral, optimistic, and pessimistic priors, respectively). There was a very low probability that the effect size was equal or larger than a consensus-defined minimal clinically important difference. Patients allocated to the accelerated strategy had a lower number of KRT-free days (median absolute difference of - 3.55 days [95\% CrI - 6.38; - 0.48]), with a probability that the accelerated strategy was associated with more KRT-free days of 0.008. Hospital-free days were similar between strategies, with the accelerated strategy having a median absolute difference of 0.48 more hospital-free days (95\% CrI - 1.87; 2.72) compared with the standard strategy and the probability that the accelerated strategy had more hospital-free days was 0.66. In a Bayesian reanalysis of the STARRT-AKI trial, we found very low probability that an accelerated strategy has clinically important benefits compared with the standard strategy. Patients receiving the accelerated strategy probably have fewer days alive and KRT-free. These findings do not support the adoption of an accelerated strategy of KRT initiation.},

Clinical and laboratory studies have questioned whether specific fluid types result in improved outcomes, including mortality and acute kidney injury.To determine the effect of a balanced solution vs saline solution (0.9\% sodium chloride) on 90-day survival in critically ill patients.Double-blind, factorial, randomized clinical trial conducted at 75 ICUs in Brazil. Patients who were admitted to the ICU with at least 1 risk factor for worse outcomes, who required at least 1 fluid expansion, and who were expected to remain in the ICU for more than 24 hours were randomized between May 29, 2017, and March 2, 2020; follow-up concluded on October 29, 2020. Patients were randomized to 2 different fluid types (a balanced solution vs saline solution reported in this article) and 2 different infusion rates (reported separately).Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either a balanced solution (n\,=\,5522) or 0.9\% saline solution (n\,=\,5530) for all intravenous fluids.The primary outcome was 90-day survival.Among 11\,052 patients who were randomized, 10\,520 (95.2\%) were available for the analysis (mean age, 61.1 [SD, 17] years; 44.2\% were women). There was no significant interaction between the 2 interventions (fluid type and infusion speed; P\,=\,.98). Planned surgical admissions represented 48.4\% of all patients. Of all the patients, 60.6\% had hypotension or vasopressor use and 44.3\% required mechanical ventilation at enrollment. Patients in both groups received a median of 1.5 L of fluid during the first day after enrollment. By day 90, 1381 of 5230 patients (26.4\%) assigned to a balanced solution died vs 1439 of 5290 patients (27.2\%) assigned to saline solution (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97 [95\% CI, 0.90-1.05]; P\,=\,.47). There were no unexpected treatment-related severe adverse events in either group.Among critically ill patients requiring fluid challenges, use of a balanced solution compared with 0.9\% saline solution did not significantly reduce 90-day mortality. The findings do not support the use of this balanced solution.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02875873},

Such models have played a pivotal role in the COVID-19 pandemic, with transmission models\textemdash and, by consequence, modelers\textemdash guiding global, national, and local responses to SARS-CoV-2. However, these models have largely not accounted for the social and structural factors, which lead to socioeconomic, racial, and geographic health disparities. In this piece, we raise and attempt to clarify several questions relating to this important gap in the research and practice of infectious disease modeling: Why do epidemiologic models of emerging infections typically ignore known structural drivers of disparate health outcomes? What have been the consequences of a framework focused primarily on aggregate outcomes on infection equity? What should be done to develop a more holistic approach to modeling-based decision-making during pandemics? In this review, we evaluate potential historical and political explanations for the exclusion of drivers of disparity in infectious disease models for emerging infections, which have often been characterized as ``equal opportunity infectors'' despite ample evidence to the contrary. We look to examples from other disease systems (HIV, STIs) and successes in including social inequity in models of acute infection transmission as a blueprint for how social connections, environmental, and structural factors can be integrated into a coherent, rigorous, and interpretable modeling framework. We conclude by outlining principles to guide modeling of emerging infections in ways that represent the causes of inequity in infection as central rather than peripheral mechanisms.},

The dataset we generated including numeric and categorical variables and firstly the numeric variables would be converted to factor variables according to cutoff points identified by the LOESS smoother. Then risk points of each variable, which are related to the coefficients in logistic regression, are assigned to each level of the converted factor variables and other categorical variables. Finally, the total score is calculated for each subject to represent the prediction of the outcome event probability. The original dataset is split into training and validation subsets. Discrimination and calibration are evaluated in the validation subset. R codes with explanations are presented in the main text.}

  abstract = {Background: The U.S. lacks a stroke surveillance system. This study develops a method to transform an existing registry into a nationally representative database to evaluate acute ischemic stroke care quality. Methods: Two statistical approaches are used to develop post-stratification weights for the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry by anchoring population estimates to the National Inpatient Sample. Post-stratification survey weights are estimated using a raking procedure and Bayesian interpolation methods. Weighting methods are adjusted to limit the dispersion of weights and make reasonable epidemiologic estimates of patient characteristics, quality of hospital care, and clinical outcomes. Standardized differences in national estimates are reported between the two post-stratification methods for anchored and non-anchored patient characteristics to evaluate estimation quality. Primary measures evaluated are patient and hospital characteristics, stroke severity, vital and laboratory measures, disposition, and clinical outcomes at discharge. Results: A total of 1,388,296 acute ischemic strokes occurred between 2012 and 2014. Raking and Bayesian estimates of clinical data not available in administrative data are estimated within 5 to 10\% of margin for expected values. Median weight for the raking method is 1.386 and the weights at the 99th percentile is 6.881 with a maximum weight of 30.775. Median Bayesian weight is 1.329 and the 99th percentile weights is 11.201 with a maximum weight of 515.689. Conclusions: Leveraging existing databases with patient registries to develop post-stratification weights is a reliable approach to estimate acute ischemic stroke epidemiology and monitoring for stroke quality of care nationally. These methods may be applied to other diseases or settings to better monitor population health.},

METHODS: The population-based Scottish Audit of Intracranial Vascular Malformations prospectively identified adults resident in Scotland first diagnosed with CCM during 1999 to 2003 or 2006 to 2010. We compared the association between beta-blocker or statin drug use after first presentation and the occurrence of new intracranial hemorrhage or persistent/progressive focal neurological deficit due to CCM for up to 15 years of prospective follow-up. We confirmed proportional hazards and used survival analysis with multivariable adjustment for age, intracranial hemorrhage at CCM presentation, and brain stem CCM location. RESULTS: Sixty-three (21\%) of 300 adults used beta-blockers (27/63 [43\%] used propranolol), and 73 (24\%) used statin drugs over 3634 person-years of follow-up. At baseline, the only statistically significant imbalances in prespecified potential confounders were age by statin use and intracranial hemorrhage at presentation by beta-blocker use. Beta-blocker use was associated with a lower risk of new intracranial hemorrhage or persistent/progressive focal neurological deficit (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.09 [95\% CI, 0.01\textendash 0.66]; P=0.018). Statin use was associated with a nonsignificant lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage or persistent/progressive focal neurological deficit (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37 [95\% CI, 0.01\textendash 1.07]; P=0.067). CONCLUSIONS: Beta-blocker, but not statin, use was associated with a lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage or persistent/ progressive focal neurological deficit in patients with CCM.},

  abstract = {We use information derived from over 40K trials in the Cochrane Collaboration database of systematic reviews (CDSR) to compute the replication probability, or predictive power of an experiment given its observed (two-sided) P-value. We find that an exact replication of a marginally significant result with P = .05 has less than 30\% chance of again reaching significance. Moreover, the replication of a result with P = .005 still has only 50\% chance of significance. We also compute the probability that the direction (sign) of the estimated effect is correct, which is closely related to the type S error of Gelman and Tuerlinckx. We find that if an estimated effect has P = .05, there is a 93\% probability that its sign is correct. If P = .005, then that probability is 99\%. Finally, we compute the required sample size for a replication study to achieve some specified power conditional on the p-value of the original study. We find that the replication of a result with P = .05 requires a sample size more than 16 times larger than the original study to achieve 80\% power, while P = .005 requires at least 3.5 times larger sample size. These findings confirm that failure to replicate the statistical significance of a trial does not necessarily indicate that the original result was a fluke.},
