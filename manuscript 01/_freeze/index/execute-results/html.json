Previous research involving patients with ischemic stroke provide evidence that those with right hemispheric injury present later to the hospital and may not be treated as frequently with thrombolytic therapy.[@legge_neglecting_2006; @di_legge_impact_2005] On the other hand, there is a hesitation among some practitioners to offer decompressive craniectomy in patients with dominant-hemispheric infarcts. [@lin_decompressive_2021-1]\n\nIt is unclear how previous research in the ischemic stroke population translates to patients experiencing intracerebral hemorrhage. Not much has been investigated.\n\nWe aimed to evaluate the effect of hemispheric lateralization on the probability of receiving aggressive care in patients with ICH.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study Design and Participants\n\nWe conducted a cohort study using data from 2 prospective studies: the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH-2) trial [@qureshi_intensive_2016] and the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH)[@woo_ethnicracial_2013] study. ATACH-2 was a large, multicenter, international, open-label, blinded-endpoint randomized controlled trial enrolling 1000 patients with ICH while ERICH was a large, multicenter, prospective observational study enrolling patients in the United States admitted with ICH. Study protocols and results of both studies have been previously published and are available elsewhere.\n\nWe included all patients enrolled in these two studies with supratentorial location of ICH. We excluded patients with cerebellar or brainstem ICH as well as any patient with primary intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).\n\nThe study was approved by the institutional review board of the Wake Forest School of Medicine.\n\n#### Data Availability Statement\n\nThe ATACH-2 (PI: Adnan I. Qureshi, MD, NCT01176565) and ERICH (PI: Daniel Woo, MD, MS, NCT01202864) data and analyses presented in this manuscript are based on the research files downloaded from the Archived Clinical Research web site of the National Institute of Neurologic Disease and Stroke (NINDS). The datasets can be obtained after approval of a written proposal as outlined on the NINDS website. \n\nAs outlined in the NINDS Data Request Agreement, the analysis code is publicly available at [https://github.com/nikhilpatelmd/ich-laterality](https://github.com/nikhilpatelmd/ich-laterality).\n\n### Exposures and Outcomes\n\nOur exposure was hemispheric laterality (left versus right). Our primary outcome was neurosurgical intervention, defined as receiving a hematoma evacuation, decompressive craniectomy, or other craniotomy. \n\nTo explore differences in other aspects of aggressive care, we defined several secondary outcomes: receipt of external ventricular drain (EVD), tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order at any point in the hospitalization, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) at any point in the hospitalization, and early WLST (< 72 from symptom onset).\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\n#### Overall Analysis Plan\n\n## Results\n\n### Baseline Characteristics\n\nA total of 3477 patients were included in the analysis, of which 1720 (49.5%) had left hemispheric ICH. They had higher NIHSS scores, higher GCS scores, and lower rates of hypertension as compared to those with right hemispheric ICH (@tbl-1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-1 .cell tbl-cap='Baseline Characteristics'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# with_dir(here(), tar_read(table_1_aggressive)) |>\n#   as_flex_table() |>\n#   font(part = \"all\", fontname = \"Figtree\") |>\n#   fontsize(size = 11, part = \"header\") |>\n#   fontsize(size = 10) |>\n#   theme_zebra() |>\n#   line_spacing(space = 1.25, part = \"all\") |>\n#   padding(padding = 4, part = \"all\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Left hemispheric ICH and neurosurgical intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-2 .cell tbl-cap='Association between hemispheric lateralization and care'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nsummary <- modelsummary(models,\n  exponentiate = TRUE,\n  fmt = 2,\n  estimate = \"{estimate}\",\n  statistic = \"{conf.low} - {conf.high}\",\n  coef_omit = \"^(?!b_ich_lat)\",\n  coef_rename = c(\"b_ich_lateralityRight\" = \"Right Hemisphere ICH\"),\n  gof_map = c(\"none\")\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Left hemispheric ICH and other measures of aggressive care\n\n### Subgroup analyses\n\n### Sensitivity analyses\n\n## Discussion\n\nHello\n\n## Acknowledgments {.appendix}\n\n## References {.appendix}",
