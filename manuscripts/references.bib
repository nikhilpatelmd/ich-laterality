Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that blinded analysts applying target trial emulation to existing observational data could predict the results of an RCT. Methods: PreVent (Preventing Hypoxemia with Manual Ventilation during Endotracheal Intubation) was a multicenter RCT examining the effects of positive-pressure ventilation during tracheal intubation on oxygen saturation and severe hypoxemia. Analysts unaware of PreVent's results used patient-level data from three previous trials evaluating airway management interventions to emulate PreVent's eligibility criteria, randomization procedure, and statistical analysis. After PreVent's release, results of this blinded observational analysis were compared with those of the RCT. Difference-in-differences estimates for comparison of treatment effects between the observational analysis and the PreVent trial are reported on the absolute scale.},

  abstract = {Magnitude of intracranial pressure (ICP) elevations and their duration have been associated with worse outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injuries (TBI), however published thresholds for injury vary and uncertainty about these levels has received relatively little attention. In this study, we have analyzed high-resolution ICP monitoring data in 227 adult patients in the CENTER-TBI dataset. Our aim was to identify thresholds of ICP intensity and duration associated with worse outcome, and to evaluate the uncertainty in any such thresholds. We present ICP intensity and duration plots to visualize the relationship between ICP events and outcome. We also introduced a novel bootstrap technique to evaluate uncertainty of the equipoise line. We found that an intensity threshold of 18 {\textpm} 4 mmHg (2 standard deviations) was associated with worse outcomes in this cohort. In contrast, the uncertainty in what duration is associated with harm was larger, and safe durations were found to be population dependent. The pressure and time dose (PTD) was also calculated as area under the curve above thresholds of ICP. A relationship between PTD and mortality could be established, as well as for unfavourable outcome. This relationship remained valid for mortality but not unfavourable outcome after adjusting for IMPACT core variables and maximum therapy intensity level. Importantly, during periods of impaired autoregulation (defined as pressure reactivity index (PRx){$>$}0.3) ICP events were associated with worse outcomes for nearly all durations and ICP levels in this cohort and there was a stronger relationship between outcome and PTD. Whilst caution should be exercised in ascribing causation in observational analyses, these results suggest intracranial hypertension is poorly tolerated in the presence of impaired autoregulation. ICP level guidelines may need to be revised in the future taking into account cerebrovascular autoregulation status considered jointly with ICP levels.},

The acute treatment of aSAH is well documented but less is known about the long-term effects of aSAH on cognition and day-to-day functioning. METHODS: We reviewed all studies in the past 10 years that have focused on the effects of aSAH on cognition and day-to-day functioning. RESULTS: Sixty-one empirical studies examining cognitive and functional outcome in patients with aSAH met inclusion criteria. Survivors of aSAH commonly experience deficits in memory, executive function, and language. These cognitive impairments interact to affect patients' day-to-day functioning, including activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, return to work, and quality of life. Deficits in cognition and day-to-day functioning are further compounded by depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Much remains to be learned about the brain changes underlying cognitive and functional deficits, including the role of diffuse brain damage and secondary complications like vasospasm and elevated intracranial pressure. A consideration of these issues is necessary to obtain a better understanding of how aSAH affects cognition and day-to-day functioning in the long-term.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose: Historically, overall outcomes for patients with high-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have been poor. Generally, between physicians, either reluctance to treat, or selectivity in treating such patients has been the paradigm. Recent studies have shown that early and aggressive care leads to significant improvement in survival rates and favorable outcomes of grade V SAH patients. With advancements in both neurocritical care and end-of-life care, nontreatment or selective treatment of grade V SAH patients is rarely justified. Current paradigm shifts towards early and aggressive care in such cases may lead to improved outcomes for many more patients. Materials and methods: We performed a detailed review of the current literature regarding neurointensive management strategies in high-grade SAH, discussing multiple aspects. We discussed the neurointensive care management protocols for grade V SAH patients. Results: Acutely, intracranial pressure control is of utmost importance with external ventricular drain placement, sedation, optimization of cerebral perfusion pressure, osmotherapy and hyperventilation, as well as cardiopulmonary support through management of hypotension and hypertension. Conclusions: Advancements of care in SAH patients make it unethical to deny treatment to poor Hunt and Hess grade patients. Early and aggressive treatment results in a significant improvement in survival rate and favorable outcome in such patients.},

  abstract = {The Restart or Stop Antithrombotics Randomized Trial (RESTART) found that antiplatelet therapy appeared to be safe up to 5 years after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) that had occurred during antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) therapy.To monitor adherence, increase duration of follow-up, and improve precision of estimates of the effects of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent ICH and major vascular events.From May 22, 2013, through May 31, 2018, this prospective, open, blinded end point, parallel-group randomized clinical trial studied 537 participants at 122 hospitals in the UK. Participants were individuals 18 years or older who had taken antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of occlusive vascular disease when they developed ICH, discontinued antithrombotic therapy, and survived for 24 hours. After initial follow-up ended on November 30, 2018, annual follow-up was extended until November 30, 2020, for a median of 3.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.0-5.0 years) for the trial cohort.Computerized randomization that incorporated minimization allocated participants (1:1) to start or avoid antiplatelet therapy.Participants were followed up for the primary outcome (recurrent symptomatic ICH) and secondary outcomes (all major vascular events) for up to 7 years. Data from all randomized participants were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for minimization covariates.A total of 537 patients (median age, 76.0 years; IQR, 69.0-82.0 years; 360 [67.0\%] male; median time after ICH onset, 76.0 days; IQR, 29.0-146.0 days) were randomly allocated to start (n\,=\,268) or avoid (n\,=\,269 [1 withdrew]) antiplatelet therapy. The primary outcome of recurrent ICH affected 22 of 268 participants (8.2\%) allocated to antiplatelet therapy compared with 25 of 268 participants (9.3\%) allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.49-1.55; P\,=\,.64). A major vascular event affected 72 participants (26.8\%) allocated to antiplatelet therapy compared with 87 participants (32.5\%) allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.58-1.08; P\,=\,.14).Among patients with ICH who had previously taken antithrombotic therapy, this study found no statistically significant effect of antiplatelet therapy on recurrent ICH or all major vascular events. These findings provide physicians with some reassurance about the use of antiplatelet therapy after ICH if indicated for secondary prevention of major vascular events.isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN71907627},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Thrombolytic agents, including tenecteplase, are generally used within 4.5 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms. Information on whether tenecteplase confers benefit beyond 4.5 hours is limited. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with ischemic stroke to compare tenecteplase (0.25 mg per kilogram of body weight, up to 25 mg) with placebo administered 4.5 to 24 hours after the time that the patient was last known to be well. Patients had to have evidence of occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery and salvageable tissue as determined on perfusion imaging. The primary outcome was the ordinal score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability and a score of 6 indicating death) at day 90. Safety outcomes included death and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS The trial enrolled 458 patients, 77.3\% of whom subsequently underwent thrombectomy; 228 patients were assigned to receive tenecteplase, and 230 to receive placebo. The median time between the time the patient was last known to be well and randomization was approximately 12 hours in the tenecteplase group and approximately 13 hours in the placebo group. The median score on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days was 3 in each group. The adjusted common odds ratio for the distribution of scores on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days for tenecteplase as compared with placebo was 1.13 (95\% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.57; P\,=\,0.45). In the safety population, mortality at 90 days was 19.7\% in the tenecteplase group and 18.2\% in the placebo group, and the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 3.2\% and 2.3\%, respectively.

CME at NEJM.org CONCLUSIONS Tenecteplase therapy that was initiated 4.5 to 24 hours after stroke onset in patients with occlusions of the middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery, most of whom had undergone endovascular thrombectomy, did not result in better clinical outcomes than those with placebo. The incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was similar in the two groups. (Funded by Genentech; TIMELESS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03785678.)},

To maximize interpretation, we present a post hoc Bayesian reanalysis.           DESIGN:~           Bayesian reanalysis of a randomized placebo-controlled trial.           SETTING:~           Thirty-five ICUs.           PATIENTS:~           Adults with proven or suspected infection, vasopressor support, and no more than 24 hours of ICU admission.           INTERVENTIONS:~           Patients were allocated to receive either vitamin C (50\,mg/kg of body weight) or placebo every 6 hours for up to 96 hours.           MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:~           The primary outcome was the composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction (i.e., vasopressor use, invasive mechanical ventilation, or new renal replacement therapy) at 28 days. We used Bayesian log-binomial models with random effects for hospital site and varying informative prior beliefs for the effect of vitamin C to estimate risk ratios (RRs) with 95\% credible intervals (Crls) in the intention to treat population (vitamin C, 435 patients; placebo, 437 patients). Using weakly neutral priors, patients allocated to vitamin C had a higher risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days (RR, 1.20; 95\% Crl, 1.04--1.39; probability of harm, 99\%). This effect was consistent when using optimistic (RR, 1.14; 95\% Crl, 1.00--1.31; probability of harm, 98\%) and empiric (RR, 1.09; 95\% Crl, 0.97--1.22; probability of harm, 92\%) priors. Patients allocated to vitamin C also had a higher risk of death at 28 days under weakly neutral (RR, 1.17; 95\% Crl, 0.98--1.40; probability of harm, 96\%), optimistic (RR, 1.10; 95\% Crl, 0.94--1.30; probability of harm, 88\%), and empiric (RR, 1.05; 95\% Crl, 0.92--1.19; probability of harm, 76\%) priors.           CONCLUSIONS:~           The use of vitamin C in adult patients with proven or suspected infection and vasopressor support is associated with high probability of harm.},

However, DAGs can be difficult to design, and the validity of any DAG-derived strategy hinges on the validity of the postulated DAG itself. Researchers should therefore check whether the assumptions encoded in the DAG are consistent with the data before proceeding with the analysis. Here, we explain how the R package `dagitty', based on the web tool dagitty.net, can be used to test the statistical implications of the assumptions encoded in a given DAG.

However, their use to counteract life-threatening hypotension comes with potential adverse effects, so that non-adrenergic vasopressors may also be considered. The use of agents that act through different mechanisms may also provide an advantage. Nitric oxide (NO) is the main driver of the vasodilation that leads to hypotension in septic shock, so several agents have been tested to counteract its effects. The use of non-selective NO synthase inhibitors has been of questionable benefit. Methylene blue, an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, an important enzyme involved in the NO signaling pathway in the vascular smooth muscle cell, has also been proposed. However, more than 25 years since the first clinical evaluation of MB administration in septic shock, the safety and benefits of its use are still not fully established, and it should not be used routinely in clinical practice until further evidence of its efficacy is available.},

  abstract = {To the Editor: In a multicenter trial, Finfer et al. (March 3 issue)1 addressed an important clinical issue: whether to use a multielectrolyte solution or saline in critically ill adults. In accordance with the protocol, patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) were assigned to receive balanced multielectrolyte solution (BMES) or saline during their entire stay in the ICU. The median duration of treatment with the assigned trial fluid was 6.0 days (interquartile range, 3.0 to 10.0) in both groups. We can thus assume that 75\% of the patients remained in the ICU at the end of day 3 and . . .}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ARDS Clinical Trials Network recommends a target partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) between 55 and 80 mm Hg. Prospective validation of this range in patients with ARDS is lacking. We hypothesized that targeting the lower limit of this range would improve outcomes in patients with ARDS. METHODS In this multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned patients with ARDS to receive either conservative oxygen therapy (target Pao2, 55 to 70 mm Hg; oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry [Spo2], 88 to 92\%) or liberal oxygen therapy (target Pao2, 90 to 105 mm Hg; Spo2, {$\geq$}96\%) for 7 days. The same mechanical-ventilation strategies were used in both groups. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 28 days. The authors' affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

RESULTS After the enrollment of 205 patients, the trial was prematurely stopped by the data and safety monitoring board because of safety concerns and a low likelihood of a significant difference between the two groups in the primary outcome. Four patients who did not meet the eligibility criteria were excluded. At day 28, a total of 34 of 99 patients (34.3\%) in the conservative-oxygen group and 27 of 102 patients (26.5\%) in the liberal-oxygen group had died (difference, 7.8 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -4.8 to 20.6). At day 90, 44.4\% of the patients in the conservative-oxygen group and 30.4\% of the patients in the liberal-oxygen group had died (difference, 14.0 percentage points; 95\% CI, 0.7 to 27.2). Five mesenteric ischemic events occurred in the conservative-oxygen group. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with ARDS, early exposure to a conservative-oxygenation strategy with a Pao2 between 55 and 70 mm Hg did not increase survival at 28 days.

  abstract = {\textbf{\emph{Background and Purpose:}} Hemispheric location might influence outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). INTERACT suggested higher short-term mortality in right hemispheric ICH, yet statistical imbalances were not addressed. This study aimed at determining the differences in long-term functional outcome in patients with right- vs. left-sided ICH with a priori-defined sub-analysis of lobar vs. deep bleedings. \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} Data from a prospective hospital registry were analyzed including patients with ICH admitted between January 2006 and August 2014. Data were retrieved from institutional databases. Outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Outcome measures (long-term mortality and functional outcome at 12 months) were correlated with ICH location and hemisphere, and the imbalances of baseline characteristics were addressed by propensity score matching. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} A total of 831 patients with supratentorial ICH (429 left and 402 right) were analyzed. Regarding clinical baseline characteristics in the unadjusted overall cohort, there were differences in disfavor of right-sided ICH (antiplatelets: 25.2\% in left ICH vs. 34.3\% in right ICH; \emph{p} {$<$} 0.01; previous ischemic stroke: 14.7\% in left ICH vs. 19.7\% in right ICH; \emph{p} = 0.057; and presence/extent of intraventricular hemorrhage: 45.0\% in left ICH vs. 53.0\% in right ICH; \emph{p} = 0.021; Graeb-score: 0 [0-4] in left ICH vs. 1 [0-5] in right ICH; \emph{p} = 0.017). While there were no differences in mortality and in the proportion of patients with favorable vs. unfavorable outcome (mRS 0-3: 142/375 [37.9\%] in left ICH vs. 117/362 [32.3\%] in right ICH; \emph{p} = 0.115), patients with left-sided ICH showed excellent outcome more frequently (mRS 0-1: 64/375 [17.1\%] in left ICH vs. 43/362 [11.9\%] in right ICH; \emph{p} = 0.046) in the unadjusted analysis. After adjusting for confounding variables, a well-balanced group of patients (\emph{n} = 360/hemisphere) was compared showing no differences in long-term functional outcome (mRS 0-3: 36.4\% in left ICH vs. 33.9\% in right ICH; \emph{p} = 0.51). Sub-analyses of patients with deep vs. lobar ICH revealed also no differences in outcome measures (mRS 0-3: 53/151 [35.1\%] in left deep ICH vs. 53/165 [32.1\%] in right deep ICH; \emph{p} = 0.58). \textbf{\emph{Conclusion:}} Previously described differences in clinical end points among patients with left- vs. right-hemispheric ICH may be driven by different baseline characteristics rather than by functional deficits emerging from different hemispheric functions affected. After statistical corrections for confounding variables, there was no impact of hemispheric location on functional outcome after ICH.},

  abstract = {Some patients, following brain injury, do not outwardly respond to spoken commands, yet show patterns of brain activity that indicate responsiveness. This is `cognitive-motor dissociation' (CMD). Recent research has used machine learning to diagnose CMD from electroencephalogram recordings. These techniques have high false discovery rates, raising a serious problem of inductive risk. It is no solution to communicate the false discovery rates directly to the patient's family, because this information may confuse, alarm and mislead. Instead, we need a procedure for generating case-specific probabilistic assessments that can be communicated clearly. This article constructs a possible procedure with three key elements: (1) A shift from categorical `responding or not' assessments to degrees of evidence; (2) The use of patient-centred priors to convert degrees of evidence to probabilistic assessments; and (3) The use of standardised probability yardsticks to convey those assessments as clearly as possible.},

An interrupted time series analysis was used to assess study outcomes before and after interventions to encourage use of lactated Ringer solution.Implementation program combining order set modification, electronic order entry alerts, and sequential clinician-targeted education to encourage prescribing of lactated Ringer solution instead of normal saline.The primary implementation outcome was the patient-level proportion of intravenous fluids that was balanced crystalloids. The primary effectiveness outcome was the incidence of major adverse kidney events (MAKE30)---a composite of new persistent kidney dysfunction, new initiation of dialysis, and death---at 30 days.Among 148\,423 patients (median [IQR] age, 47 [30-67] years; 91\,302 women [61\%]), the proportion of total fluids received that was lactated Ringer solution increased from 28\% to 75\% in the first week vs the last week of the study (immediate implementation effect odds ratio [OR], 3.44; 95\% CI, 2.79-4.24). The estimated MAKE30 absolute risk reduction was 2.2\% (95\% CI, 1.3\%-3.3\%) based on interrupted time series analysis showing a decrease in the week-on-week trend for MAKE30 (OR difference, 0.03; 95\% CI, 0.03-0.03, P\,\&lt;\,.001). The immediate postimplementation OR for MAKE30 was 0.88 (95\% CI, 0.76-1.01), with a decrease in persistent kidney dysfunction (OR, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.69-0.93) and mortality (OR, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.65-0.93) but not dialysis (OR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.76-1.32).In this comparative effectiveness study, an implementation program was associated with an increase in the proportion of fluids administered as lactated Ringer solution compared with normal saline and was associated with a reduction in MAKE30 events among patients treated in a large integrated health care system.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study from 2016 to 2020 used the enhanced claims-based Premier Healthcare Database, which included approximately 25\% of US hospitalizations. Participants were adult patients hospitalized with septic shock and receiving norepinephrine who began hydrocortisone treatment. Data analysis was performed from May 2022 to December 2022. EXPOSURE Addition of fludrocortisone on the same calendar day that hydrocortisone treatment was initiated vs use of hydrocortisone alone. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Composite of hospital death or discharge to hospice. Adjusted risk differences were calculated using doubly robust targeted maximum likelihood estimation. RESULTS Analyses included 88 275 patients, 2280 who began treatment with hydrocortisone-fludrocortisone (median [IQR] age, 64 [54-73] years; 1041 female; 1239 male) and 85 995 (median [IQR] age, 67 [57-76] years; 42 136 female; 43 859 male) who began treatment with hydrocortisone alone. The primary composite outcome of death in hospital or discharge to hospice occurred among 1076 (47.2\%) patients treated with hydrocortisonefludrocortisone vs 43 669 (50.8\%) treated with hydrocortisone alone (adjusted absolute risk difference, -3.7\%; 95\% CI, -4.2\% to -3.1\%; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this comparative effectiveness cohort study among adult patients with septic shock who began hydrocortisone treatment, the addition of fludrocortisone was superior to hydrocortisone alone.},

  abstract = {Background Inhaled vasodilators nitric oxide and epoprostenol may be initiated to improve oxygenation in mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory failure; however, practice patterns and head-to-head comparisons of effectiveness are unclear. Research Question What are the practice patterns and comparative effectiveness for inhaled nitric oxide and epoprostenol in severe acute respiratory failure? Study Design and Methods Using a large United States database (Premier Healthcare Database), we identified adult patients with acute respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome who were mechanically ventilated and started on inhaled nitric oxide, epoprostenol or both. Leveraging large hospital variation in the choice of initial inhaled vasodilator, we compared the effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide to epoprostenol by limiting analysis to patients admitted to hospitals that exclusively used either inhaled nitric oxide or epoprostenol. The primary outcome of successful extubation was modeled using multivariable Fine-Grey competing risk (death or hospice discharge) time to event models. Results Among 11,200 patients (303 hospitals), 6,366 (56.8\%) received inhaled nitric oxide first, 4,720 (42.1\%) received inhaled epoprostenol first, and 114 (1.0\%) received both therapies on the same day. 104 hospitals (34.3\%; 1,666 patients) exclusively used nitric oxide and 118 hospitals (38.9\%; 1,812 patients) exclusively used epoprostenol. There were no differences in the likelihood of successful extubation between patients admitted to nitric oxide-only hospitals versus epoprostenol-only hospitals (sub-distribution hazard ratio 0.97, 95\% CI 0.80-1.18). There were also no differences in total hospital costs or death. Results were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. Interpretation There is large variation in the use of initial inhaled vasodilator for respiratory failure across United hospitals. Comparative effectiveness analyses identified no differences in outcomes based on inhaled vasodilator type.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe practice variation in IMV discontinuation internationally, associations between initial discontinuation events and outcomes, and factors associated with the use of select discontinuation strategies and failed initial spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective, multinational, observational study of critically ill adults who received IMV for at least 24 hours from 142 intensive care units (ICUs) in 19 countries within 6 regions (27 in Canada, 23 in India, 22 in the UK, 26 in Europe, 21 in Australia/New Zealand, and 23 in the US). EXPOSURES Receiving IMV. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary analyses characterized types of initial IMV discontinuation events (extubation, SBT, or tracheostomy) and associations with clinical outcomes (including duration of ventilation, ICU and hospital mortality, and ICU and hospital length of stay). Secondary analyses examined the associations between SBT outcome and SBT timing and clinical outcomes. RESULTS Among 1868 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 61.8 [48.9-73.1] years; 1173 [62.8\%] men) 424 (22.7\%) underwent direct extubation, 930 (49.8\%) had an initial SBT (761 [81.8\%] successful), 150 (8.0\%) underwent direct tracheostomy, and 364 (19.5\%) died before a weaning attempt. Across regions, there was variation in the use of written directives to guide care, daily screening, SBT techniques, ventilator modes, and the roles played by clinicians involved in weaning. Compared with initial direct extubation, patients who had an initial SBT had higher ICU mortality (20 [4.7\%] vs 96 [10.3\%]; absolute difference, 5.6\% [95\% CI, 2.6\%-8.6\%]), longer duration of ventilation (median of 2.9 vs 4.1 days; absolute difference, 1.2 days [95\% CI, 0.7-1.6]), and longer ICU stay (median of 6.7 vs 8.1 days; absolute difference, 1.4 days [95\% CI, 0.8-2.4]). Patients whose initial SBT failed (vs passed) had higher ICU mortality (29 [17.2\%] vs 67 [8.8\%]; absolute difference, 8.4\% [95\% CI, 2.0\%-14.7\%]), longer duration of ventilation (median of 6.1 vs 3.5 days; absolute difference, 2.6 days [95\% CI, 1.6-3.6]), and longer ICU stay (median of 10.6 vs 7.7 days; absolute difference, 2.8 days [95\% CI, 1.1-5.2]). Compared with patients who underwent early initial SBTs, patients who underwent late initial SBTs ({$>$}2.3 days after intubation) had longer duration of ventilation (median of 2.1 vs 6.1 days; absolute difference, 4.0 days [95\% CI, 3.7-4.5]), longer ICU stay (median of 5.9 vs 10.8 days; absolute difference, 4.9 days [95\% CI, 4.0-6.3]), and longer hospital stay (median of 14.3 vs 22.8 days; absolute difference, 8.5 days [95\% CI, 6.0-11.0]).

We generated multivariable linear regression models to evaluate the association between sex and EQ-5D while sequentially adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical, and stroke-related variables. We also used a proportional odds model to assess sex differences in the change in EQ-5D scores from 3 to 12 months. Correspondence to Dr. Bushnell: cbushnel@wakehealth.edu Results: A total of 1,370 patients were included, 53.7\% male, median age 65 years (interquartile range 56--77 years). Women had significantly lower QOL at 3 months (unadjusted EQ-5D 0.81 in women vs 0.84 in men; p , 0.001) and 12 months (0.83 vs men 0.84; p , 0.001) poststroke. After multivariable adjustment for sociodemographic, clinical, and stroke-related factors, women continued to have lower QOL at 3 months (mean difference 20.036; p 5 0.003) and at 12 months (mean difference 20.022; p 5 0.046). Women fared worse in the dimensions of mobility, pain/ discomfort, and anxiety/depression at 3 and 12 months. There were no sex differences in change in EQ-5D score from 3 to 12 months.

A lot of the recent writing has focused on concerns of causal identification (under which conditions is it, in principle, possible to recover causal effects?); in this primer, we turn to causal estimation (how do we actually turn the data into an effect estimate?) and modern approaches to it that are commonly used in epidemiology. First, we explain how causal estimands can be defined rigorously with the help of the potential outcomes framework, and we highlight four crucial assumptions necessary for causal inference to succeed (exchangeability, positivity, consistency, and non-interference). Next, we present three types of approaches to causal estimation and compare their strengths and weaknesses: propensity score methods (in which the independent variable is modeled as a function of controls), g-computation methods (in which the dependent variable is modeled as a function of both controls and the independent variable), and doubly robust estimators (which combine models for both independent and dependent variables). A companion R Notebook can be found at github.com/ArthurChatton/CausalCookbook. We hope that this non-technical introduction not only helps psychologists and other social scientists expand their causal toolbox but also facilitates communication across disciplinary boundaries when it comes to causal inference, a research goal common to all fields of research.},

  abstract = {cal trials and evidence to date, prognostic considerations, controversies, recent developments, and future directions in SAH. RECENT FINDINGS  Historically, management of SAH focused on prevention and treatment of subsequent cerebral vasospasm, which was thought to be the primary cause of delayed cerebral ischemia. Clinical and translational studies over the past decade, including several therapeutic phase 3 randomized clinical trials, suggest that the pathophysiology of SAH-associated brain injury is multiphasic and multifactorial beyond large vessel cerebral vasospasm. The quest to reduce SAH-associated brain injury and improve outcomes is shifting away from large vessel cerebral vasospasm to a new paradigm targeting multiple brain injury mechanisms, including early brain injury, delayed cerebral ischemia, microcirculatory dysfunction, spreading cortical depolarization, inflammation, and the brain-body interaction in vascular brain injury with critical illness. Despite multiple negative randomized clinical trials in search of potential therapeutic agents ameliorating the downstream effects after SAH, the overall outcome of SAH has improved over recent decades, likely related to improvements in interventional options for ruptured cerebral aneurysms and in critical care management. Emerging clinical evidence also suggests potential harmful impact of historic empiric treatments for SAH-associated vasospasm, such as prophylactic induction of hypertension, hypervolemia, and hemodilution (triple H therapy). With decreasing mortality, long-term SAH survivorship and efforts to reduce chronic morbidity and to improve quality of life and patient-centered outcome are growing areas of unmet need. Despite existing guidelines, significant variabilities in local and regional practices and in scientific terminologies have historically limited advancement in SAH care and therapeutic development. Large global collaborative efforts developed harmonized SAH common data elements in 2019, and studies are under way to examine how existing variabilities in SAH care impact long-term SAH outcomes. SUMMARY  Although the overall incidence and mortality of SAH is decreasing with advances in preventive and acute care, SAH remains a major cause of long-term morbidity in survivors. Significant variabilities in care settings and empiric treatment protocols and inconsistent scientific terminologies have limited advancement in patient care and therapeutic clinical studies. Large consensus efforts are under way to introduce clinical guidelines and common data elements to advance therapeutic approaches and improve patient outcome....},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine, by retrospective analysis, critical thresholds for intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and fluid balance associated with poor outcome in patients with severe brain injury. DESIGN: Retrospective review of patient data from the prospective, randomized, multicenter National Acute Brain Injury Study: Hypothermia, comparing outcome results at 6 months after injury with intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and fluid balance measurements recorded during the 96-hr period after randomization. SETTING: Emergency departments and intensive care units in 11 metropolitan tertiary care university hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 392 patients, aged 16-65 yrs, with severe, nonpenetrating brain injuries and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3-8 after resuscitation, who were enrolled in a study designed to determine the treatment effect of moderate hypothermia in patients with severe brain injury. INTERVENTION: Standard brain injury treatment for 193 randomly assigned patients and standard treatment plus hypothermia for 48 hrs for 199 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intracranial pressure levels of 20, 25, and 30 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure levels of 70 and 80 mm Hg, cerebral perfusion pressure levels of 50, 60, and 70 mm Hg, and fluid balance levels in quartiles were examined for their effect on outcome as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 months after injury. When considered separately, any of the following-intracranial pressure {$>$}25 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure {$<$}70 mm Hg, or cerebral perfusion pressure {$<$}60 mm Hg and fluid balance lower than -594 mL-was associated with an increased percentage of patients with poor outcome. When the variables were combined into a stepwise logistic regression model, Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission, age, mean arterial pressure {$<$}70 mm Hg, fluid balance lower than -594 mL, and intracranial pressure {$>$} 25 mm Hg, in that order, were the most powerful variables in determining outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Exceeding thresholds of intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, and fluid volume may be detrimental to severe brain injury outcome. Fluid balance lower than -594 mL was associated with an adverse effect on outcome, independent of its relationship to intracranial pressure, mean arterial pressure, or cerebral perfusion pressure.},

Design, Setting, and Patients:~         Refractory cardiogenic shock is almost always lethal without emergency circulatory support, e.g., ECMO. ECMO-associated morbidity and mortality plead for identification of early predictors of its failure, and detailed analyses of short- and long-term outcomes to refine patient selection and improve results. Outcomes of 81 patients given ECMO support for medical (n = 55), postcardiotomy (n = 16), or posttransplantation (n = 10) cardiogenic shock were evaluated.         Measurements and Main Results:~         Thirty-four (42\%) patients survived to hospital discharge; 57\% suffered {$\geq$}1 major ECMO-related complications. Independent predictors of intensive care unit death were: device insertion under cardiac massage (odds ratio [OR] = 20.68), 24 hr urine output {$<$}500 mL (OR = 6.52), prothrombin activity {$<$}50\% (OR = 3.93), and female sex (OR = 3.89); myocarditides were associated with better outcomes (OR = .13). Sequelae and health-related quality-of-life were evaluated for 28 long-term survivors (median follow-up, 11 months), whose mean Short-Form 36 scores were significantly lower than matched healthy controls for physical role, general health, and social functioning, but higher than those reported for patients on chronic hemodialysis, with advanced heart failure, or after recovery from acute respiratory distress syndrome.         Conclusions:~         ECMO support can rescue 40\% of otherwise fatal cardiogenic shock patients but its initiation under cardiac massage or after renal or hepatic failure carried higher risks of intensive care unit death, while fulminant myocarditis had a better prognosis. Despite satisfactory mental health and vitality, long-term survivors' persistent physical and social problems might benefit from tailored medical or psychosocial interventions.},

Methods---A formal literature search of MEDLINE (November 1, 2006, through May 1, 2010) was performed. Data were synthesized with the use of evidence tables. Writing group members met by teleconference to discuss data-derived recommendations. The American Heart Association Stroke Council's Levels of Evidence grading algorithm was used to grade each recommendation. The guideline draft was reviewed by 7 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council Leadership and Manuscript Oversight Committees. It is intended that this guideline be fully updated every 3 years. Results---Evidence-based guidelines are presented for the care of patients presenting with aSAH. The focus of the guideline was subdivided into incidence, risk factors, prevention, natural history and outcome, diagnosis, prevention of rebleeding, surgical and endovascular repair of ruptured aneurysms, systems of care, anesthetic management during repair, management of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia, management of hydrocephalus, management of seizures, and management of medical complications. Conclusions---aSAH is a serious medical condition in which outcome can be dramatically impacted by early, aggressive, expert care. The guidelines offer a framework for goal-directed treatment of the patient with aSAH. (Stroke. 2012;43:1711-1737.)},

The first description of fluids for resuscitation of a critically ill patient occurred during the 1830s cholera outbreak in England. In the 200 years since, debates continue surrounding the volume, composition, and rate of fluid administration, with few definitive answers to guide clinicians.Previous studies have demonstrated that mortality is decreased when critically ill patients receive early fluid resuscitation during septic shock and hemorrhagic shock, although studies exploring the rate of fluid resuscitation have largely been absent. Although there is some intuitive appeal to rapid resuscitation in an underresuscitated patient, the potential benefits may be counterbalanced by concerns that overly rapid fluid administration may impair right ventricular function, worsen tissue edema, and decrease organ function.},

Practical recommendations regarding selection and monitoring of therapies for initial management of cerebral edema for optimal efficacy and safety are generally lacking. This guideline evaluates the role of hyperosmolar agents (mannitol, HTS), corticosteroids, and selected non-pharmacologic therapies in the acute treatment of cerebral edema. Clinicians must be able to select appropriate therapies for initial cerebral edema management based on available evidence while balancing efficacy and safety. Methods:{\enspace} The Neurocritical Care Society recruited experts in neurocritical care, nursing, and pharmacy to create a panel in 2017. The group generated 16 clinical questions related to initial management of cerebral edema in various neurological insults using the PICO format. A research librarian executed a comprehensive literature search through July 2018. The panel screened the identified articles for inclusion related to each specific PICO question and abstracted necessary information for pertinent publications. The panel used GRADE methodology to categorize the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on their confidence that the findings of each publication approximate the true effect of the therapy. Results:{\enspace} The panel generated recommendations regarding initial management of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, bacterial meningitis, and hepatic encephalopathy. Conclusion:{\enspace} The available evidence suggests hyperosmolar therapy may be helpful in reducing ICP elevations or cerebral edema in patients with SAH, TBI, AIS, ICH, and HE, although neurological outcomes do not appear to be affected. Corticosteroids appear to be helpful in reducing cerebral edema in patients with bacterial meningitis, but not ICH.},

There are increasing data that the patient's quality of life and functional status can be affected long after an intensive care unit stay, and some data suggest that mechanical ventilation strategies could influence those outcomes. Critical care clinicians' decisions regarding mechanical ventilation and related treatments such as level of sedation might have more profound and far-reaching residual effects than has been previously recognized. To deliver effective, cost-effective, and patient-centered care, critical-care clinicians must consider outcomes other than survival. These outcomes include such diverse concepts as quality of life, functional status, and neuropsychological function.

Even traditional covariance analysis adjustments may be inadequate to eliminate this bias. The propensity score, defined as the conditional probability of being treated given the covariates, can be used to balance the covariates in the two groups, and therefore reduce this bias. In order to estimate the propensity score, one must model the distribution of the treatment indicator variable given the observed covariates. Once estimated the propensity score can be used to reduce bias through matching, stratification (subclassification), regression adjustment, or some combination of all three. In this tutorial we discuss the uses of propensity score methods for bias reduction, give references to the literature and illustrate the uses through applied examples. {\copyright} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {This article introduces a collection of four datasets, similar to Anscombe's quartet, that aim to highlight the challenges involved when estimating causal effects. Each of the four datasets is generated based on a distinct causal mechanism: the first involves a collider, the second involves a confounder, the third involves a mediator, and the fourth involves the induction of M-Bias by an included factor. The article includes a mathematical summary of each dataset, as well as directed acyclic graphs that depict the relationships between the variables. Despite the fact that the statistical summaries and visualizations for each dataset are identical, the true causal effect differs, and estimating it correctly requires knowledge of the data-generating mechanism. These example datasets can help practitioners gain a better understanding of the assumptions underlying causal inference methods and emphasize the importance of gathering more information beyond what can be obtained from statistical tools alone. The article also includes R code for reproducing all figures and provides access to the datasets themselves through an R package named ``quartets.''

  abstract = {Purpose Little is known about how physicians discuss prognosis with terminally ill cancer patients. Thus, we sought to obtain cancer physicians' self-reports of their prognosis communication practices. Methods A survey seeking self-reports regarding prognosis communication with their terminally ill cancer patients was mailed to a systematic sample of medical oncologists in the United States. Results Of 1,137 physicians, 729 completed and returned surveys (64\% response rate). Median age of respondents was 51 years (range, 33 to 80 years); 82\% were men. Respondents had practiced cancer care for a median of 18 years (range, 1.5 to 50 years) and reported seeing a median of 60 patients per week (range, 0 to 250 patients per week). Although 98\% said their usual practice is to tell terminally ill patients that they will die, 48\% specifically described communicating terminal prognoses to patients only when specific preferences for prognosis information were expressed. Forty-three percent said they always or usually communicate a medical estimate of time as to when death is likely to occur, and 57\% reported sometimes, rarely, or never giving a time frame. Seventy-three percent said prognosis communication education was either absent or inadequate during their training, and 96\% believed it should be part of cancer care training. Conclusion Medical oncologists report routinely informing their terminally ill patients that they will die. However, they are divided in describing themselves as either always discussing a terminal prognosis or doing so if it is consistent with their patients' preferences for prognostic information. Most medical oncologists say they do not routinely communicate an estimated survival time to their patients.},

Patients Seventy-three pairs of ARDS survivors and severity-matched controls with the clinical risk factors for ARDS of sepsis and trauma admitted between January 1, 1994, and July 30, 1996. Main Outcome Measures The HRQL of ARDS survivors and controls, assessed by generic and pulmonary disease--specific HRQL instruments (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, Standard Form [SF-36] and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ], respectively). Results Clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in HRQL scores of ARDS survivors (n = 73) were seen in 7 of 8 SF-36 domains and 3 of 3 SGRQ domains compared with matched controls (PϽ.001 for all reductions). The largest decrements in the HRQL were seen in physical function and pulmonary symptoms and limitations. Analysis of trauma-matched pairs (n = 46) revealed significant reductions in 7 of 8 SF-36 domains (PՅ.02) and 3 of 3 SGRQ domains (PՅ.003). Analysis of sepsis-matched pairs (n = 27) revealed significant reductions in 6 of 8 SF-36 domains (PՅ.05) and 3 of 3 SGRQ domains (PՅ.002). Conclusions Survivors of ARDS have a clinically significant reduction in HRQL that appears to be caused exclusively by ARDS and its sequelae. Reductions were primarily noted in physical functioning and pulmonary disease--specific domains.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to examine whether hospitalization for pneumonia is associated with functional decline, cognitive impairment, and depression, and to compare this impairment with that seen after known disabling conditions, such as myocardial infarction or stroke. METHODS: We used data from a prospective cohort of 1434 adults aged more than 50 years who survived 1711 hospitalizations for pneumonia, myocardial infarction, or stroke drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (1998-2010). Main outcome measures included the number of Activities and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living requiring assistance and the presence of cognitive impairment and substantial depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Hospitalization for pneumonia was associated with 1.01 new impairments in Activities and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-1.32) among patients without baseline functional impairment and 0.99 new impairments in Activities and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (95\% CI, 0.57-1.41) among those with mild-to-moderate baseline limitations, as well as moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment (odds ratio, 2.46; 95\% CI, 1.60-3.79) and substantial depressive symptoms (odds ratio, 1.63; 95\% CI, 1.06-2.51). Patients without baseline functional impairment who survived pneumonia hospitalization had more subsequent impairments in Activities and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living than those who survived myocardial infarction hospitalization. There were no significant differences in subsequent moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment or substantial depressive symptoms between patients who survived myocardial infarction or stroke and those who survived pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization for pneumonia in older adults is associated with subsequent functional and cognitive impairment. Improved pneumonia prevention and interventions to ameliorate adverse sequelae during and after hospitalization may improve outcomes.},

Studies on functional outcome after stroke and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) comparing both hemispheres showed conflicting results so far. The impact of stroke laterality on patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after EVT has not yet been adequately addressed and still remains unclear.                                         Methods               Consecutive stroke thrombectomy patients, derived from a multi-center, prospective registry (German Stroke Registry) between June 2015 and December 2019, were included in this study. At 90~days, outcome after EVT was assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and HRQoL using the European QoL-five dimensions questionnaire utility-index (EQ-5D-I; higher values indicate better HRQoL) in patients with LHS and RHS. Adjusted regression analysis was applied to evaluate the influence of stroke laterality on outcome after EVT.                                         Results               In total, 5683 patients were analyzed. Of these, 2953 patients (52.8\%) had LHS and 2637 (47.2\%) RHS. LHS patients had a higher baseline NIHSS (16 vs. 13, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and a higher ASPECTS (9 vs. 8, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) compared to RHS patients. Among survivors, patients with LHS less frequently had a self-reported affected mobility (p\,=\,0.037), suffered less often from pain (p\,=\,0.04) and anxiety/depression (p\,=\,0.032) three months after EVT. After adjusting for confounders (age, sex, baseline NIHSS), LHS was associated with a better HRQoL ({\ss} coefficient 0.04, CI 95\% 0.017--0.063; p\,=\,0.001), and better functional outcome assessed by lower values on the mRS ({\ss} coefficient -\,0.109, CI 95\% -\,0.217--0.000; p\,=\,0.049).                                         Conclusions               Ninety days after EVT, LHS patients have a better functional outcome and HRQoL. Patients with RHS should be actively assessed and treated for pain, anxiety and depression to improve their HRQoL after EVT.},

Unfortunately, corticosteroids are associated with numerous and well-characterized adverse effects, constituting a major challenge in patients requiring long-term application of corticosteroids. Novel anti-angiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab (Avastin{\textregistered}), which have been increasingly used in cancer patients, are associated with significant steroid-sparing effects, allowing neuro-oncologists to reduce the overall use of corticosteroids in patients with progressive malignant brain tumors. Recent experimental studies have revealed novel insights into the mechanisms and effects of corticosteroids in cancer patients, including modulation of tumor biology, angiogenesis and steroid-associated neurotoxicity. This article summarizes current concepts of using corticosteroids in brain cancer patients and highlights potential pitfalls in their effects on both tumor and neural progenitor cells.},

  abstract = {Background: Only a small percentage of patients with acute stroke are treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Objective: To investigate why patients with right-hemisphere strokes seem at high risk of not receiving rt-PA. Methods: This study includes two phases. Phase 1: the authors compared demographic, clinical, and outcome measures between patients with right- and left-hemisphere strokes in the rt-PA Registry of Southwestern Ontario (RSWO); Phase 2: the authors tested the hypotheses generated in Phase 1 using the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network (RCSN). A multiple logistic analysis was applied to detect independent predictors of rt-PA administration. Results: Phase 1: of 179 rt-PA-treated patients, 39\% had right-hemisphere syndrome. Patients with right-hemisphere strokes had a longer hospital stay (15 vs 9 days; p ϭ 0.03). Phase 2: of 990 stroke patients in the RCSN, 505 (51\%) had a right- and 485 (49\%) a left-hemisphere syndrome. Of 110 rt-PA-treated patients, 37 (34\%) had a right-hemisphere syndrome (p ϭ 0.0001). Negative independent predictors of rt-PA administration were right-hemisphere stroke (OR, 0.55; CI: 0.31 to 0.96; p ϭ 0.037), onset-to-emergency department time (OR, 0.99; CI 0.98 to 0.99; p ϭ 0.04), and CNS score (OR, 0.78; CI 0.71 to 0.86; p Ͻ 0.0001). Neglect predicted rt-PA administration (OR, 2.32; CI 1.29 to 4.16; p ϭ 0.004). Conclusions: Patients with right-hemisphere strokes are 45\% less likely to be treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) compared to patients with left-hemisphere strokes. The presence of neglect confers a twofold increased likelihood of rt-PA administration. Prehospital delay and lack of standardized scores for the neglect syndrome may limit accessibility of patients with right-hemisphere stroke to thrombolysis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Traditionally, the dominant (usually left) cerebral hemisphere is regarded as the more important one, and everyday clinical decisions are influenced by this view. However, reported results on the impact of lesion laterality are inconsistent in the scarce literature on quality of life (QOL) in patients with brain tumors. The authors aimed to study which cerebral hemisphere is the most important to patients with intracranial tumors with respect to health-related QOL (HRQOL). METHODS Two hundred forty-eight patients with unilateral, unifocal gliomas or meningiomas scheduled for primary surgery were included in this prospective cohort study. Generic HRQOL was measured using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire preoperatively and after 4--6 weeks. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of data were performed. RESULTS Tumor volumes were significantly larger in right-sided tumors at diagnosis, and language or speech problems were more common in left-sided lesions. Otherwise, no differences existed in baseline data. The median EQ-5D-3L index was 0.73 (range -0.24 to 1.00) in patients with right-sided tumors and 0.76 (range -0.48 to 1.00) in patients with left-sided tumors (p = 0.709). Due to the difference in tumor volumes at baseline, histopathology and tumor volumes were matched in 198 patients. EQ-5D-3L index scores in this 1:1 matched analysis were 0.74 (range -0.7 to 1.00) for patients with right-sided and 0.76 (range -0.48 to 1.00) for left-sided lesions (p = 0.342). In the analysis of longitudinal data, no association was found between tumor laterality and postoperative EQ-5D-3L index scores (p = 0.957) or clinically significant change in HRQOL following surgery (p = 0.793). CONCLUSIONS In an overall patient-reported QOL perspective, tumor laterality does not appear to be of significant importance for generic HRQOL in patients with intracranial tumors. This may imply that right-sided cerebral functions are underestimated by clinicians.},

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between functional outcome, measured by mRS, and cognition, measured by mini-mental state examination (MMSE), after aSAH. A secondary analysis evaluated the impact of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) on the proportion of patients who had cognitive impairment. Methods We performed a post hoc analysis of the Clazosentan to Overcome Neurological Ischemia and Infarction Occurring After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (CONSCIOUS-1) trial data. MMSE and mRS scores were compared using Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test with pairwise comparison post hoc analysis. Cognitive impairment was defined as MMSE score {$<$}27. A stepwise logistic regression model evaluated whether DCI was a predictor of cognitive impairment. Results CONSCIOUS-1 comprised 413 patients. Of these, 337 took an MMSE at their 12-week follow-up. Mean MMSE score was 27 with a median of 29 (range, 0--30; SD 5.4). There were no significant differences between MMSE scores of patients who had 12-week mRS scores of 0--2. On multivariate analysis, DCI was independently associated with cognitive impairment after aSAH. Conclusions Patients considered to have a good outcome on mRS had varying degrees of cognitive function on MMSE, whereas development of DCI was an independent predictor of cognitive impairment after aSAH. MMSE may not be sensitive enough to discern subtle defects in cognition, as the median score was 29 out of~30.},

Advanced neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques have revealed new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying recovery of consciousness and have enabled the identification of preserved brain networks in patients who seem unresponsive, thus raising hope for more accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Emerging evidence suggests that covert consciousness, or cognitive motor dissociation (CMD), is present in up to 15--20\% of patients with DoC and that detection of CMD in the intensive care unit can predict functional recovery at 1\,year post injury. Although fundamental questions remain about which patients with DoC have the potential for recovery, novel pharmacological and electrophysiological therapies have shown the potential to reactivate injured neural networks and promote re-emergence of consciousness. In this Review, we focus on mechanisms of recovery from DoC in the acute and subacute-to-chronic stages, and we discuss recent progress in detecting and predicting recovery of consciousness. We also describe the developments in pharmacological and electrophysiological therapies that are creating new opportunities to improve the lives of patients with DoC.},

  abstract = {Objectives To determine whether decline in cognitive function was greater among older individuals who experienced acute care or critical illness hospitalizations relative to those not hospitalized and to determine whether the risk for incident dementia differed by these exposures. Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of data from a prospective cohort study from 1994 through 2007 comprising 2929 individuals 65 years old and older without dementia at baseline residing in the community in the Seattle area and belonging to the Group Health Cooperative. Participants with 2 or more study visits were included, and those who had a hospitalization for a diagnosis of primary brain injury were censored at the time of hospitalization. Individuals were screened with the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) (score range, 0-100) every 2 years at follow-up visits, and those with a score less than 86 underwent a clinical examination for dementia. Main Outcome Measures Score on the CASI at follow-up study visits and incident dementia diagnosed in study participants, adjusted for baseline cognitive scores, age, and other risk factors. Results During a mean (SD) follow-up of 6.1 (3.2) years, 1601 participants had no hospitalization, 1287 had 1 or more noncritical illness hospitalizations, and 41 had 1 or more critical illness hospitalizations. The CASI score was assessed more than 45 days after discharge for 94.3\% of participants. Adjusted CASI scores averaged 1.01 points lower for visits following acute care illness hospitalization compared with follow-up visits not following any hospitalization (95\% confidence interval [CI], -1.33 to -0.70; PϽ.001) and 2.14 points lower on average for visits following critical illness hospitalization (95\% CI, -4.24 to -0.03; P=.047). There were 146 cases of dementia among those not hospitalized, 228 cases of dementia among those with 1 or more noncritical illness hospitalizations, and 5 cases of dementia among those with 1 or more critical illness hospitalizations. The adjusted hazard ratio for incident dementia was 1.4 following a noncritical illness hospitalization (95\% CI, 1.1 to 1.7; P=.001) and 2.3 following a critical illness hospitalization (95\% CI, 0.9 to 5.7; P=.09). Conclusions Among a cohort of older adults without dementia at baseline, those who experienced acute care hospitalization and critical illness hospitalization had a greater likelihood of cognitive decline compared with those who had no hospitalization. Noncritical illness hospitalization was significantly associated with the development of dementia.},

Design and Setting A prospective, observational study of European ICUs. Participants Consecutive patients who died or had any limitation of therapy. Intervention Prospectively defined end-of-life practices in 37 ICUs in 17 European countries were studied from January 1, 1999, to June 30, 2000. Main Outcome Measures Comparison and analysis of the frequencies and patterns of end-of-life care by geographic regions and different patients and professionals. Results Of 31417 patients admitted to ICUs, 4248 patients (13.5\%) died or had a limitation of life-sustaining therapy. Of these, 3086 patients (72.6\%) had limitations of treatments (10\% of admissions). Substantial intercountry variability was found in the limitations and the manner of dying: unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 20\% (range, 5\%-48\%), brain death in 8\% (range, 0\%-15\%), withholding therapy in 38\% (range, 16\%-70\%), withdrawing therapy in 33\% (range, 5\%-69\%), and active shortening of the dying process in 2\% (range, 0\%-19\%). Shortening of the dying process was reported in 7 countries. Doses of opioids and benzodiazepines reported for shortening of the dying process were in the same range as those used for symptom relief in previous studies. Limitation of therapy vs continuation of life-sustaining therapy was associated with patient age, acute and chronic diagnoses, number of days in ICU, region, and religion (PϽ.001). Conclusion The limiting of life-sustaining treatment in European ICUs is common and variable. Limitations were associated with patient age, diagnoses, ICU stay, and geographic and religious factors. Although shortening of the dying process is rare, clarity between withdrawing therapies and shortening of the dying process and between therapies intended to relieve pain and suffering and those intended to shorten the dying process may be lacking.},

  abstract = {Intravascular fluid therapy is a common critical care intervention. However, the optimal type of resuscitation fluid, crystalloid or colloid, remains controversial. Despite the many theoretical benefits of human albumin administration in critically ill patients, there has been little evidence to support its widespread clinical use. Previous systematic reviews have led to conflicting results regarding the safety and efficacy of albumin. The recently reported Saline versus Albumin Evaluation study has provided conclusive evidence that 4\% albumin is as safe as saline for resuscitation, although no overall benefit of albumin use was seen. Subgroup analysis of the albumin-treated group revealed a trend towards decreased mortality in patients with septic shock, and a trend towards increased mortality in trauma patients, especially those with traumatic brain injury. The results of these subgroups, as well as the use of higher albumin concentrations and other synthetic colloids (dextrans, starches), require rigorous evaluation in clinical trials. Finally, the Saline versus Albumin Evaluation trial represents a methodological milestone in critical care medicine, due to its size, its efficient trial design, and its logistical coordination. Future studies are still required, however, to establish a therapeutic niche for albumin and other colloids.},

Recent findings~         Maintaining euvolemia with crystalloids seems to be the recommended fluid resuscitation for neurocritical care patients. Buffered crystalloids have been shown to reduce hyperchloremia in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage without causing hyponatremia or hypo-osmolality. In addition, in patients with traumatic brain injury, buffered solutions reduce the incidence of hyperchloremic acidosis but are not associated with intracranial pressure (ICP) alteration. Both mannitol and hypertonic saline are established as effective hyperosmolar agents to control ICP. Both agents have been shown to control ICP, but their effects on neurologic outcomes are unclear. A recent surge in preference for using hypertonic saline as a hyperosmolar agent is based on few studies without strong evidence.         Summary~         Fluid resuscitation with crystalloids seems to be reasonable in this setting although no recommendations can be made regarding type of crystalloids.

Non--vitamin K oral anticoagulants have not been evaluated in randomized controlled trials in CVT.To compare the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate with those of dose-adjusted warfarin in preventing recurrent VTEs in patients who have experienced a CVT.RE-SPECT CVT is an exploratory, prospective, randomized (1:1), parallel-group, open-label, multicenter clinical trial with blinded end-point adjudication (PROBE design). It was performed from December 21, 2016, to June 22, 2018, with a follow-up of 25 weeks, at 51 tertiary sites in 9 countries (France, Germany, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, and Spain). Adult consecutive patients with acute CVT, who were stable after 5 to 15 days of treatment with parenteral heparin, were screened for eligibility. Patients with CVT associated with central nervous system infection or major trauma were excluded, but those with intracranial hemorrhage from index CVT were allowed to participate. After exclusions, 120 patients were randomized. Data were analyzed following the intention-to-treat approach.Dabigatran, 150 mg twice daily, or dose-adjusted warfarin for a treatment period of 24 weeks.Primary outcome was a composite of patients with a new VTE (recurrent CVT, deep vein thrombosis of any limb, pulmonary embolism, and splanchnic vein thrombosis) or major bleeding during the study period. Secondary outcomes were cerebral venous recanalization and clinically relevant non--major bleeding events.In total, 120 patients with CVT were randomized to the 2 treatment groups (60 to dabigatran and 60 to dose-adjusted warfarin). Of the randomized patients, the mean (SD) age was 45.2 (13.8) years, and 66 (55.0\%) were women. The mean (SD) duration of exposure was 22.3 (6.16) weeks for the dabigatran group and 23.0 (5.20) weeks for the warfarin group. No recurrent VTEs were observed. One (1.7\%; 95\% CI, 0.0-8.9) major bleeding event (intestinal) was recorded in the dabigatran group, and 2 (3.3\%; 95\% CI, 0.4-11.5) (intracranial) in the warfarin group. One additional patient (1.7; 95\% CI, 0.0-8.9) in the warfarin group experienced a clinically relevant non--major bleeding event. Recanalization occurred in 33 patients in the dabigatran group (60.0\%; 95\% CI, 45.9-73.0) and in 35 patients in the warfarin group (67.3\%; 95\% CI, 52.9-79.7).This trial found that patients who had CVT anticoagulated with either dabigatran or warfarin had low risk of recurrent VTEs, and the risk of bleeding was similar with both medications, suggesting that both dabigatran and warfarin may be safe and effective for preventing recurrent VTEs in patients with CVT.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02913326},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Whether the use of balanced multielectrolyte solution (BMES) in preference to 0.9\% sodium chloride solution (saline) in critically ill patients reduces the risk of acute kidney injury or death is uncertain. METHODS In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned critically ill patients to receive BMES (Plasma-Lyte 148) or saline as fluid therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 90 days. The primary outcome was death from any cause within 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes were receipt of new renal-replacement therapy and the maximum increase in the creatinine level during ICU stay. RESULTS A total of 5037 patients were recruited from 53 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand --- 2515 patients were assigned to the BMES group and 2522 to the saline group. Death within 90 days after randomization occurred in 530 of 2433 patients (21.8\%) in the BMES group and in 530 of 2413 patients (22.0\%) in the saline group, for a difference of -0.15 percentage points (95\% confidence interval [CI], -3.60 to 3.30; P\,=\,0.90). New renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 306 of 2403 patients (12.7\%) in the BMES group and in 310 of 2394 patients (12.9\%) in the saline group, for a difference of -0.20 percentage points (95\% CI, -2.96 to 2.56). The mean ({\textpm}SD) maximum increase in serum creatinine level was 0.41{\textpm}1.06 mg per deciliter (36.6{\textpm}94.0 {$\mu$}mol per liter) in the BMES group and 0.41{\textpm}1.02 mg per deciliter (36.1{\textpm}90.0 {$\mu$}mol per liter) in the saline group, for a difference of 0.01 mg per deciliter (95\% CI, -0.05 to 0.06) (0.5 {$\mu$}mol per liter [95\% CI, -4.7 to 5.7]).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The influence of stroke lateralization on functional and cardiovascular outcome after stroke is not well established. We evaluated the influence of hemispheric lateralization among patients enrolled in prospective acute stroke trials. METHODS: We obtained data from the VISTA database for acute stroke trials which reported lateralization. Baseline data, cardiac adverse events, and 90-day outcomes were compared between right and left hemisphere stroke patients. A "hemisphere unbiased" subscore of the NIHSS which omitted items strongly associated with lateralized cognitive deficits was also compared for trials which reported individual NIHSS item scores. A multivariable analysis of outcome predictors was performed. RESULTS: Three acute stroke trials met the prespecified inclusion criteria. 1644 placebo-treated patients with documented hemispheric lateralization were included in the analysis. Baseline NIHSS was higher for left hemisphere patients (mean 16.2, versus 12.8 right, P{$<$}0.001); there was no difference in the "hemisphere unbiased" NIHSS subscore (10.88 left, 11.08 right, n=687, P=0.49). There was no difference between hemispheres in 90-day modified Rankin Score (3.43 left, 3.29 right, P=0.13), mortality (22.1\% left, 19.5\% right, P=0.20), or cardiac adverse events (P=0.71). Hemispheric lateralization was not an independent predictor of outcome in the multivariable analysis after controlling for the hemispheric bias intrinsic to the NIHSS. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in functional outcome between patients with right or left hemisphere stroke. Use of the baseline NIHSS score to predict stroke outcome must take hemispheric lateralization into account. Stroke lateralization is not an important predictor of cardiac adverse events or 90-day mortality.},

And yet in our experience, introductory epidemiology courses were the last time we spent any significant amount of training time focused on descriptive epidemiology. This gave us the impression that descriptive epidemiology does not suffer from bias and is less impactful than causal epidemiology. Descriptive epidemiology may also suffer from a lack of prestige in academia and may be more difficult to fund. We believe this does a disservice to the field and slows progress towards goals of improving population health and ensuring equity in health. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak and subsequent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic have highlighted the importance of descriptive epidemiology in responding to serious public health crises. In this commentary, we make the case for renewed focus on the importance of descriptive epidemiology in the epidemiology curriculum using SARS-CoV-2 as a motivating example. The framework for error we use in etiological research can be applied in descriptive research to focus on both systematic and random error. We use the current pandemic to illustrate differences between causal and descriptive epidemiology and areas where descriptive epidemiology can have an important impact.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a multicenter, randomized trial conducted in 20 emergency departments and 1 intensive care unit (ICU) that included comatose patients with suspected acute poisoning and a Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 9 in France between May 16, 2021, and April 12, 2023, and followed up until May 12, 2023. INTERVENTION Patients were randomized to undergo conservative airway strategy of intubation withholding vs routine practice. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a hierarchical composite end point of in-hospital death, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay. Key secondary outcomes included adverse events resulting from intubation as well as pneumonia within 48 hours. RESULTS Among the 225 included patients (mean age, 33 years; 38\% female), 116 were in the intervention group and 109 in the control group, with respective proportions of intubations of 16\% and 58\%. No patients died during the in-hospital stay. There was a significant clinical benefit for the primary end point in the intervention group, with a win ratio of 1.85 (95\% CI, 1.33 to 2.58). In the intervention group, there was a lower proportion with any adverse event (6\% vs 14.7\%; absolute risk difference, 8.6\% [95\% CI, -16.6\% to -0.7\%]) compared with the control group, and pneumonia occurred in 8 (6.9\%) and 16 (14.7\%) patients, respectively (absolute risk difference, -7.8\% [95\% CI, -15.9\% to 0.3\%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among comatose patients with suspected acute poisoning, a conservative strategy of withholding intubation was associated with a greater clinical benefit for the composite end point of in-hospital death, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The questions patients are asked about their preferences with regard to life-sustaining treatment usually focus on specific interventions, but the outcomes of treatment and their likelihood affect patients' preferences. METHODS: We administered a questionnaire about treatment preferences to 226 persons who were 60 years of age or older and who had a limited life expectancy due to cancer, congestive heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study participants were asked whether they would want to receive a given treatment, first when the outcome was known with certainty and then with different likelihoods of an adverse outcome. The outcome without treatment was specified as death from the underlying disease. RESULTS: The burden of treatment (i.e., the length of the hospital stay, extent of testing, and invasiveness of interventions), the outcome, and the likelihood of the outcome all influenced treatment preferences. For a low-burden treatment with the restoration of current health, 98.7 percent of participants said they would choose to receive the treatment (rather than not receive it and die), but 11.2 percent of these participants would not choose the treatment if it had a high burden. If the outcome was survival but with severe functional impairment or cognitive impairment, 74.4 percent and 88.8 percent of these participants, respectively, would not choose treatment. The number of participants who said they would choose treatment declined as the likelihood of an adverse outcome increased, with fewer participants choosing treatment when the possible outcome was functional or cognitive impairment than when it was death. Preferences did not differ according to the primary diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Advance care planning should take into account patients' attitudes toward the burden of treatment, the possible outcomes, and their likelihood. The likelihood of adverse functional and cognitive outcomes of treatment requires explicit consideration.},

Data Sources:~         A search of PubMed and MEDLINE was conducted from inception through January 2015 for all English-language articles using the term ``palliative care,'' ``supportive care,'' ``end-of-life care,'' ``withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,'' ``limitation of life support,'' ``prognosis,'' or ``goals of care'' together with ``neurocritical care,'' ``neurointensive care,'' ``neurological,'' ``stroke,'' ``subarachnoid hemorrhage,'' ``intracerebral hemorrhage,'' or ``brain injury.''         Data Extraction and Synthesis:~         We reviewed the existing literature on delivery of palliative care in the neurointensive care unit setting, focusing on challenges and strategies for establishing realistic and appropriate goals of care, symptom management, organ donation, and other considerations related to use and limitation of life-sustaining therapies for neurocritically ill patients. Based on review of these articles and the experiences of our interdisciplinary/interprofessional expert advisory board, this report was prepared to guide critical care staff, palliative care specialists, and others who practice in this setting.         Conclusions:~         Most neurocritically ill patients and their families face the sudden onset of devastating cognitive and functional changes that challenge clinicians to provide patient-centered palliative care within a complex and often uncertain prognostic environment. Application of palliative care principles concerning symptom relief, goal setting, and family emotional support will provide clinicians a framework to address decision making at a time of crisis that enhances patient/family autonomy and clinician professionalism.},

METHODS~           We analyzed data from 1355 SAH patients in the placebo-arm of four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of tirilazad. Modified Fisher CT grades were calculated based the presence of cisternal blood and intraventricular hemorrhage. Crude odds ratios (OR) reflecting the risk of developing symptomatic vasospasm were calculated for each scale level, and adjusted ORs expressing the incremental risk were calculated after controlling for known predictors of vasospasm.           RESULTS~           Of 1355 patients, 451 (33\%) developed symptomatic vasospasm. For the modified Fisher scale, compared to Grade 0--1 patients, the crude OR for vasospasm was 1.6 (95\% CI 1.0--2.5) for Grade 2, 1.6 (95\% CI 1.1--2.2) for Grade 3, and 2.2 (95\% CI 1.6--3.1) for Grade 4. For the original Fisher scale, referenced to Grade 1, the OR for vasospasm was 1.3 (95\% CI 0.7--2.2) for Grade 2, 2.2 (95\% CI 1.4--3.5) for Grade 3 and 1.7 (95\% CI 1.0--3.0) for Grade 4. Early angiographic vasospasm, history of hypertension, neurological grade, and elevated admission mean arterial pressure were identified as risk factors for symptomatic vasospasm. After adjusting for these variables, the modified Fisher scale remained a significant predictor of vasospasm (adjusted OR 1.28, 95\% CI 1.06--1.54) while the original Fisher scale was not.           CONCLUSIONS~           The modified Fisher scale, which accounts for thick cisternal and ventricular blood, predicts symptomatic vasospasm after SAH more accurately than original Fisher scale.},

This narrative review appraises recent clinical studies of fluid therapy in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), with respect to its use in volume resuscitation and prevention of secondary injury.         Recent findings~         Despite the development of level 1 evidence in fluid resuscitation, in patients with TBI key questions concerning optimal composition and volume remain unanswered. In the absence of randomized trials demonstrating patient outcome differences, clinical practice is often based on physiological principles and surrogate endpoints. There is a physiological rationale why excessive fluid administration and positive fluid balance may increase brain swelling and intracranial pressure (ICP); in some patients, a lower cumulative fluid balance may improve outcomes, but limited human data exist. Resuscitation with 4\% albumin in TBI patients in ICU worsens mortality, which may be mediated by increased ICP during the first week after injury. Hypertonic saline and mannitol decrease ICP, but may not improve survival or neurological outcomes. Sodium lactate may be a future therapy for treatment and prevention of secondary brain injury.         Summary~         In patients with TBI, intravenous fluids are integral to management; they may be both a source of harm and a potential therapy to limit secondary brain injury. They should be prescribed in accordance with other pharmaceutical or therapeutic interventions. Refined usage may improve patient outcomes.},

  author = {Gelman, Andrew and O'Rourke, Keith},
  abstract = {Weighing and amalgamating evidence is a central problem in statistics, giving rise to much debate on what methods are appropriate as well as exactly where, when and for what purposes they should be used. On the other hand, the weighing and amalgamating of evidence within a single isolated study (the multiple observations) in many default approaches in statistics is surprisingly often just automatic and implicit. Now vigorous debate on basic approaches in statistics likely comes as no surprise to statisticians and increasingly almost everyone else. Although there is much agreement on mathematical definitions of terms and procedures in statistics (what they are), as well as the discerning if particular instances meet these (is it this?), when it comes to the appropriate roles for these terms and procedures in facilitating scientific inquiry - their very purposes and what to make of them - it seems beyond agreement for the foreseeable future. The tools are largely agreed upon, their appropriate use, where and for what purposes, not at all. For instance, there is a fair amount of agreement on what probabilities are, but not on what they can be used for. Many frequentests ban any use of probability in representing (uncertain) knowledge of unknown parameters. On the other hand, although almost all Bayesians would use probabilities to represent knowledge (or lack of it), some Bayesians would ban any testing or empirically based assessment of these. In the case of a single study, some statisticians would be concerned about properties of procedures that can be discerned if the procedure would be repeatedly applied infinitely often under similar kinds of studies or even exactly the same study conditions. Others argue this is not even sensible.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not oppose each other and that they give more specific guidance about what statistical science strives to achieve. Instead of debating over whether a given statistical method is subjective or objective (or normatively debating the relative merits of subjectivity and objectivity in statistical practice), we can recognize desirable attributes such as transparency and acknowledgment of multiple perspectives as complementary goals. We demonstrate the implications of our proposal with recent applied examples from pharmacology, election polling, and socioeconomic stratification.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives To investigate in routine care the efficacy and safety of IV thrombolysis (IVT) with tenecteplase prior to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic strokes (LVO-AIS), either secondarily transferred after IVT or directly admitted to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC). Methods We retrospectively analyzed clinical and procedural data of patients treated with 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase within 270 minutes of LVO-AIS who underwent brain angiography. The main outcome was 3-month functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score {$\leq$}2). Recanalization (revised Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia score 2b--3) was evaluated before (pre-MT) and after MT (final). Results We included 588 patients (median age 75 years [interquartile range (IQR) 61--84]; 315 women [54\%]; median NIH Stroke Scale score 16 [IQR 10--20]), of whom 520 (88\%) were secondarily transferred after IVT. Functional independence occurred in 47\% (n = 269/570; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 43.0--51.4) of patients. Pre-MT recanalization occurred in 120 patients (20.4\%; 95\% CI 17.2--23.9), at a similar rate across treatment paradigms (direct admission, n = 14/68 [20.6\%]; secondary transfer, n = 106/520 [20.4\%]; p {$>$} 0.99) despite a shorter median IVT to puncture time in directly admitted patients (38 [IQR 23--55] vs 86 [IQR 70--110] minutes; p {$<$} 0.001). Final recanalization was achieved in 492 patients (83.7\%; 95\%CI 80.4--86.6). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 2.5\% of patients (n = 14/567; 95\% CI 1.4--4.1). Discussions Tenecteplase before MT is safe, effective, and achieves a fast recanalization in everyday practice in patients secondarily transferred or directly admitted to a CSC, in line with published results. These findings should encourage its wider use in bridging therapy. Classification of Evidence This study provides Class IV evidence that tenecteplase within 270 minutes of LVO-AIS increases the probability of functional independence.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Primary: to demonstrate feasibility of audio-recording clinicianfamily meetings for CINPs at multiple centers and characterize how clinicians communicate prognosis during these meetings. Secondary: to explore associations of 1) clinician, family, or patient characteristics with clinicians' prognostication approaches and 2) prognostication approach and WOLST. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Forty-three audio-recorded clinician-family meetings during which prognosis was discussed from seven U.S. centers for 39 CINPs with 88 family members and 27 clinicians. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Two investigators qualitatively coded transcripts using inductive methods (inter-rater reliability {$>$} 80\%) to characterize how clinicians prognosticate. We then applied univariate and multivariable multinomial and binomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Clinicians used four distinct prognostication approaches: Authoritative (21\%; recommending treatments without discussing values and preferences); Informational (23\%; disclosing just the prognosis without further discussions); advisory (42\%; disclosing prognosis followed by discussion of values and preferences); and responsive (14\%; eliciting values and preferences, then disclosing prognosis). Before adjustment, prognostication approach was associated with center (p {$<$} 0.001), clinician specialty (neurointensivists vs non-neurointensivists; p = 0.001), patient age (p = 0.08), diagnosis (p = 0.059), and meeting length (p = 0.03). After adjustment, only clinician specialty independently predicted prognostication approach (p = 0.027). WOLST decisions occurred in 41\% of patients and were most common under the advisory approach (56\%). WOLST was more likely in older patients (p = 0.059) and with more experienced clinicians (p = 0.07). Prognostication approach was not independently associated with WOLST (p = 0.198). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: It is feasible to audio-record sensitive clinician-family meetings about CINPs in multiple ICUs. We found that clinicians prognosticate with high variability. Our data suggest that larger studies are warranted in CINPs to examine the role of clinicians' variable prognostication in WOLST decisions.},

  abstract = {Prognostication is crucial in the neurological intensive care unit (neuroICU). Patients with severe acute brain injury (SABI) are unable to make their own decisions because of the insult itself or sedation needs. Surrogate decision makers, usually family members, must make decisions on the patient's behalf. However, many are unprepared for their role as surrogates owing to the sudden and unexpected nature of SABI. Surrogates rely on clinicians in the neuroICU to provide them with an outlook (prognosis) with which to make substituted judgments and decide on treatments and goals of care on behalf of the patient. Therefore, how a prognostic estimate is derived, and then communicated, is extremely important. Prognostication in the neuroICU is highly variable between clinicians and institutions, and evidence based guidelines are lacking. Shared decision making (SDM), where surrogates and clinicians arrive together at an individualized decision based on patient values and preferences, has been proposed as an opportunity to improve clinician-family communication and ensure that patients receive treatments they would choose. This review outlines the importance and current challenges of prognostication in the neuroICU and how prognostication and SDM intersect, based on relevant research and expert opinion.},

Several factors, including patients' characteristics, the presence of hydrocephalus and intraparenchymal hematoma, might also contribute to this effect. The aim of this study was to assess the temporal changes in mortality and neurologic outcome in SAH patients and identify their predictors. Methods: We performed a single center retrospective cohort study from 2004 to 2018. All non-traumatic SAH patients with poor grade on admission (WFNS score of 4 or 5) who remained at least 24 h in the hospital were included. Time course was analyzed into four groups according to the years of admission (2004--2007; 2008--2011; 2012--2015 and 2016--2018). Results: A total of 353 patients were included in this study: 202 patients died (57 \%) and 260 (74 \%) had unfavorable neurological outcome (UO) at 3 months. Mortality tended to decrease in in 2008--2011 and 2016--2018 periods (HR 0.55 [0.34--0.89] and HR 0.33 [0.20--0.53], respectively, when compared to 2004--2007). The proportion of patients with UO remained high and did not vary significantly over time. Patients with WFNS 5 had higher mortality (68 \% vs. 34 \%, p = 0.001) and more frequent UO (83 \% vs. 54 \%, p = 0.001) than those with WFNS 4. In the multivariable analysis, WFNS 5 was independently associated with mortality (HR 2.12 [1.43--3.14]) and UO (OR 3.23 [1.67--6.25]). The presence of hydrocephalus was associated with a lower risk of mortality (HR 0.60 [0.43--0.84]). Conclusions: Both hospital mortality and UO remained high in poor grade SAH patients. Patients with WFNS 5 on admission had worse prognosis than others; this should be taken into consideration for future clinical studies.},

DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: University hospital medical intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Two hundred forty-five patients with predominantly cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic data, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, and Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) were obtained. All adult survivors staying in the intensive care unit for {$>$}24 hrs were eligible. Pre-intensive care unit status was obtained for 245 patients (179 males, mean age 64 yrs, mean intensive care unit stay 3 days, SAPS II 26 +/- 10), and 153 patients completed all three questionnaires. In this cohort, none of the eight health dimensions of the SF-36 showed impaired functioning after 9 months compared with baseline values. Physical and emotional role deteriorated after 1 month but returned to baseline thereafter. Notably, the mental health summary scale did not change during the course of the study, whereas the physical health summary scale consistently improved over time. Patients older than the median of 66 yrs rated their physical functioning lower. No association with SAPS II or SOFA and SF-36 was found. CONCLUSION: Quality of life after intensive care unit is a dynamic process, with some functions improving shortly after intensive care unit discharge and others deteriorating but returning at least to baseline values later on. In this patient population, the SF-36 was independent from measures of severity of illness or morbidity. Health-related quality of life represents a feasible method to collect patients' individual views in contrast to surrogate measures of outcome.},

METHODS: The Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study is a prospective, multicenter, case-control study of ICH risk factors and outcomes. We compared comorbidities, treatments, and use of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders in men vs women. Multivariate analysis was used to assess the likelihood of ICH surgery and palliative care after adjustment for variables that were p {$<$} 0.1 in univariate analyses and backward elimination to retain those that were significant (p {$<$} 0.05). RESULTS: Women were older on average (65.0 vs 59.9, p {$<$} 0.0001), and higher proportions of women had previous stroke (24.1\% vs 19.3\%, p = 0.002), had dementia (6.1\% vs 3.4\%, p = 0.0007), lived alone (23.1\% vs 18.0\%, p = 0.0005), and took anticoagulants (12.8\% vs 10.1\% p = 0.02), compared with men. Men had higher rates of alcohol and cocaine use. After adjusting for age, hematoma volume, and ICH location, there was no difference in rates of surgical treatment by sex (odds ratio [OR] 0.93 for men vs women, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.28, p = 0.67), and there was no difference in DNR/comfort care decisions after adjustment for ICH score, prior stroke, and dementia (OR 0.96, CI 0.77-1.22, p = 0.76). CONCLUSIONS: After ICH, women do not receive less aggressive care than men after controlling for the substantial comorbidity differences. Future studies on sex bias should include the presence of comorbidities, prestroke disability, and other factors that may influence management.},

OBJECTIVES: To determine the factors associated with large ICH and neurosurgical intervention among participants of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trials (INTERACT). METHODS: We performed pooled analysis of the pilot INTERACT1 (n = 404) and main INTERACT2 (n = 2839) studies of ICH patients ({$<$}6 h of onset) with elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP, 150-220 mm Hg) who were randomized to intensive (target SBP {$<$} 140 mm Hg) or contemporaneous guideline-recommended (target SBP {$<$} 180 mm Hg) management. Neurosurgical intervention data were collected at 7 d postrandomization. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine associations. RESULTS: There were 372 (13\%) patients with large ICH volume ({$>$}30 mL), which was associated with nonresiding in China, nondiabetic status, severe neurological deficit (National Institutes of Health stroke scale [NIHSS] score {$\geq$} 15), lobar location, intraventricular hemorrhage extension, raised leucocyte count, and hyponatremia. Significant predictors of those patients who underwent surgery (226 of 3233 patients overall; 83 of 372 patients with large ICH) were younger age, severe neurological deficit (lower Glasgow coma scale score, and NIHSS score {$\geq$} 15), baseline ICH volume {$>$} 30 mL, and intraventricular hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of severe ICH, based on age and clinical and imaging parameters, may facilitate neurosurgery and intensive monitoring of patients.},

Methods We conducted a nationwide registry-linkage study including 829 health centers, i.e., all memory clinics and {$\approx$}75\% of primary care facilities, across Sweden. Data including cognitive function from 50,076 people with incident dementia diagnoses {$\geq$}65 years of age and registered with the Swedish Dementia Register in 2007 to 2015 were used, with a maximum follow-up of 9.7 years for survival until 2016. Sociodemographic factors, comorbidity burden, medication use, and dates of death were obtained from nationwide registries. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to create tables depicting 3-year survival probabilities for different risk factor profiles. Results By August 2016, 20,828 (41.6\%) patients in our cohort had died. Median survival time from diagnosis of dementia was 5.1 (interquartile range 2.9--8.0) years for women and 4.3 (interquartile range 2.3--7.0) years for men. Predictors of mortality were higher age, male sex, increased comorbidity burden and lower cognitive function at diagnosis, a diagnosis of non-Alzheimer dementia, living alone, and using more medications. The developed prediction tables yielded c indexes of 0.70 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.69--0.71) to 0.72 (95\% CI 0.71--0.73) and showed good calibration. Conclusions Three-year survival after dementia diagnosis can be predicted with good accuracy. The survival prediction tables developed in this study may aid clinicians and patients in shared decision-making and advance care planning.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The comparative efficacy and safety of balanced crystalloid solutions and saline for fluid therapy in critically ill adults remain uncertain. METHODS We systematically reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the use of balanced crystalloids with saline in critically ill adults. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality after pooling data from low-risk-of-bias trials using a random-effects model. We also performed a Bayesian meta-analysis to describe the primary treatment effect in probability terms. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), new treatment with renal replacement therapy (RRT), and ventilator-free and vasopressor-free days to day 28. RESULTS We identified 13 RCTs, comprising 35,884 participants. From six trials (34,450 participants) with a low risk of bias, the risk ratio (RR) for 90-day mortality with balanced crystalloids versus saline was 0.96 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.01; I2 5 12.1\%); using vague priors, the posterior probability that balanced crystalloids reduce mortality was 89.5\%. The RRs of developing AKI and of being treated with RRT with balanced crystalloids versus saline were 0.96 (95\% CI, 0.89 to 1.02) and 0.95 (95\% CI, 0.81 to 1.11), respectively. Ventilator-free days (mean difference, 0.18 days; 95\% CI, 20.45 to 0.81) and vasopressor-free days (mean difference, 0.19 days; 95\% CI, 20.14 to 0.51) were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS The estimated effect of using balanced crystalloids versus saline in critically ill adults ranges from a 9\% relative reduction to a 1\% relative increase in the risk of death, with a high probability that the average effect of using balanced crystalloids is to reduce mortality.

  abstract = {Background In 2007, the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation---Translation of Research Into Practice Study (SAFE-TRIPS) reported that 0.9\% sodium chloride (saline) and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) were the most commonly used resuscitation fluids in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Evidence has emerged since 2007 that these fluids are associated with adverse patient-centred outcomes. Based on the published evidence since 2007, we sought to determine the current type of fluid resuscitation used in clinical practice and the predictors of fluid choice and determine whether these have changed between 2007 and 2014. Methods In 2014, an international, cross-sectional study was conducted (Fluid-TRIPS) to document current patterns of intravenous resuscitation fluid use and determine factors associated with fluid choice. We examined univariate and multivariate associations between patients and prescriber characteristics, geographical region and fluid type. Additionally, we report secular trends of resuscitation fluid use in a cohort of ICUs that participated in both the 2007 and 2014 studies. Regression analysis were conducted to determine changes in the administration of crystalloid or colloid between 2007 and 2014. Findings In 2014, a total of 426 ICUs in 27 countries participated. Over the 24 hour study day, 1456/6707 (21.7\%) patients received resuscitation fluid during 2716 resuscitation episodes. Crystalloids were administered to 1227/1456 (84.3\%) patients during 2208/2716 (81.3\%) episodes and colloids to 394/1456 (27.1\%) patients during 581/2716 (21.4\%) episodes. In multivariate analyses, practice significantly varied between geographical regions. Additionally, patients with a traumatic brain injury were less likely to receive colloid when compared to patients with no trauma (adjusted OR 0.24; 95\% CI 0.1 to 0.62; p = 0.003). Patients in the ICU for one or more days where more likely to receive colloid compared to patients in the ICU on their admission date (adjusted OR 1.75; 95\% CI 1.27 to 2.41; p = {$<$}0.001). For secular trends in fluid resuscitation, 84 ICUs in 17 countries contributed data. In 2007, 527/1663 (31.7\%) patients received fluid resuscitation during 1167 episodes compared to 491/1763 (27.9\%) patients during 960 episodes in 2014. The use of crystalloids increased from 498/1167 (42.7\%) in 2007 to 694/960 (72.3\%) in 2014 (odds ratio (OR) 3.75, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.95 to 4.77; p = {$<$}0.001), primarily due to a significant increase in the use of buffered salt solutions. The use of colloids decreased from 724/1167 (62.0\%) in 2007 to 297/960 (30.9\%) in 2014 (OR 0.29, 95\% CI 0.19 to 0.43; p = {$<$}0.001), primarily due to a decrease in the use of HES, but an overall increase in the use of albumin. Conclusions Clinical practices of intravenous fluid resuscitation have changed between 2007 and 2014. Geographical location remains a strong predictor of the type of fluid administered for fluid resuscitation. Overall, there is a preferential use of crystalloids, specifically buffered salt solutions, over colloids. There is now an imperative to conduct a trial determining the safety and efficacy of these fluids on patient-centred outcomes.

  abstract = {Many health professionals (HPs) express discomfort at having to broach the topic of prognosis, including limited life expectancy, and may withhold information or not disclose prognosis. A systematic review was conducted of 46 studies relating to truth-telling in discussing prognosis with patients with progressive, advanced life-limiting illnesses and their caregivers. Relevant studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified by searching computerized databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials) up to November 2004, with handsearching of studies, as well as inclusion of studies satisfying selection criteria reported in 2005 by the authors. The reference lists of identified studies were hand-searched for further relevant studies. Inclusion criteria were studies of any design evaluating communication of prognostic information that included adult patients with an advanced, life-limiting illness; their caregivers; and qualified HPs. Results showed that although the majority of HPs believed that patients and caregivers should be told the truth about the prognosis, in practice, many either avoid discussing the topic or withhold information. Reasons include perceived lack of training, stress, no time to attend to the patient's emotional needs, fear of a negative impact on the patient, uncertainty about prognostication, requests from family members to withhold information and a feeling of inadequacy or hopelessness regarding the unavailability of further curative treatment. Studies suggest that patients can discuss the topic without it having a negative impact on them. Differences and similarities in findings from different cultures are explored.

Prior research focuses on individual-level factors such as the dispositions of users or network-level factors such as echo chambers. Moving beyond these accounts, we develop and test an event-oriented explanation and demonstrate that over the course of the 2020 election year in the United States, all major shifts in political hostility on the social media platform Twitter were driven by external offline events. Importantly, these events were magnified by Twitter users within the most politically hostile and most ideologically homogeneous networks. Further contributing to the individual and network-oriented accounts, we show that divisive offline events mobilized individual users not already disposed for hostility and may have helped facilitate the formation of echo chambers. The dynamics of online interactions---including their level of hostility---seem crucially dependent on developments in the offline world.},

Whether TNK exerts distinct benefits in large vessel occlusion (LVO) AIS is still being investigated. Objective{\enspace} To describe our first-\-year experience after a healthcare system-\-wide transition from TPA to TNK as the primary thrombolytic. Methods{\enspace} Patients with AIS who received intravenous thrombolytics between January 2020 and August 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients with LVO considered for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) were included in this analysis. Spontaneous recanalization (SR) after TNK/TPA was a composite variable of reperfusion {$>$}50\% of the target vessel territory on cerebral angiography or rapid, significant neurological recovery averting MT. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to compare SR rates between TNK and TPA. Results{\enspace} A total of 148 patients were identified; 51/148 (34.5\%) received TNK and 97/148 (65.5\%) TPA. The middle cerebral arteries M1 (60.8\%) and M2 (29.7\%) were the most frequent occlusion sites. Baseline demographics were comparable between TNK and TPA groups. Spontaneous recanalization was significantly more frequently observed in the TNK than in the TPA groups (unmatched: 23.5\% vs 10.3\%, P=0.032). PSM substantiated the observed SR rates (20\% vs 10\%). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, 90-\-day mortality, and functional outcomes were similar. Conclusions{\enspace} The preliminary experience from a real-\- world setting demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of TNK before MT. The higher spontaneous recanalization rates with TNK are striking. Additional studies are required to investigate whether TNK is superior to TPA in LVO AIS.},

  abstract = {Purpose{\enspace} Long-term outcomes of critical illness may be affected by duration of critical illness and intensive care. We aimed to investigate differences in mortality and morbidity after short ({$<$}8 days) and prolonged ({$\geq$}8 days) intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Methods{\enspace} Former EPaNIC-trial patients were included in this preplanned prospective cohort, 5-year followup study. Mortality was assessed in all. For morbidity analyses, all long-stay and---for feasibility---a random sample (30\%) of short-stay survivors were contacted. Primary outcomes were total and post-28-day 5-year mortality. Secondary outcomes comprised handgrip strength (HGF, \%pred), 6-minute-walking distance (6MWD, \%pred) and SF-36 Physical Function score (PF SF-36). One-to-one propensity-score matching of shortstay and long-stay patients was performed for nutritional strategy, demographics, comorbidities, illness severity and admission diagnosis. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to explore ICU factors possibly explaining any post-ICU observed outcome differences. Results{\enspace} After matching, total and post-28-day 5-year mortality were higher for long-stayers (48.2\% (95\%CI: 43.9\% to 52.6\%) and 40.8\% (95\%CI: 36.4\% to 45.1\%)) versus short-stayers (36.2\% (95\%CI: 32.4\% to 40.0\%) and 29.7\% (95\%CI: 26.0\% to 33.5\%), p{$<$}0.001). ICU risk factors comprised hypoglycaemia, use of corticosteroids, neuromuscular blocking agents, benzodiazepines, mechanical ventilation, new dialysis and the occurrence of new infection, whereas clonidine could be protective. Among 276 long-stay and 398 short-stay 5-year survivors, HGF, 6MWD and PF SF-36 were significantly lower in long-stayers (matched subset HGF: 83\% (95\%CI: 60\% to 100\%) versus 87\% (95\%CI: 73\% to 103\%), p=0.020; 6MWD: 85\% (95\%CI: 69\% to 101\%) versus 94\% (95\%CI: 76\% to 105\%), p=0.005; PF SF-36: 65 (95\%CI: 35 to 90) versus 75 (95\%CI: 55 to 90), p=0.002).

We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.},

Methods We evaluated 109 survivors of ARDS at 3, 6, and 12 months and at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after discharge from the intensive care unit. At each visit, patients were interviewed and examined; underwent pulmonary-function tests, the 6-minute walk test, resting and exercise oximetry, chest imaging, and a quality-of-life evaluation; and reported their use of health care services. Results At 5 years, the median 6-minute walk distance was 436 m (76\% of predicted distance) and the Physical Component Score on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item ShortForm Health Survey was 41 (mean norm score matched for age and sex, 50). With respect to this score, younger patients had a greater rate of recovery than older patients, but neither group returned to normal predicted levels of physical function at 5 years. Pulmonary function was normal to near-normal. A constellation of other physical and psychological problems developed or persisted in patients and family caregivers for up to 5 years. Patients with more coexisting illnesses incurred greater 5-year costs.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the study was to assess the long term outcome and quality of life of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for refractory hypoxemia. METHODS: A retrospective observational study with prospective health related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment was conducted in ARDS patients who had ECMO as a rescue therapy for reversible refractory hypoxemia from January 2009 until April 2011 in a tertiary Australian centre. Survival and long-term quality of life assessment, using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and the EuroQol health related quality of life questionnaire (EQ5D) were assessed and compared to international data from other research groups. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (mean age 36.3 years) with ARDS receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia were studied. Eighteen (86\%) patients were retrieved from external intensive care units (ICUs) by a dedicated ECMO retrieval team. Eleven (55\%) had H1N1 influenza A-associated pneumonitis. Eighteen (86\%) patients survived to hospital discharge. Of the 18 survivors, ten (56\%) were discharged to other hospitals and 8 (44\%) were discharged directly home. Sequelae and health related quality of life were evaluated for 15 of the 18 (71\%) long-term survivors (assessment at median 8 months). Mean SF-36 scores were significantly lower across all domains compared to age and sex matched Australian norms. Mean SF-36 scores were lower (minimum important difference at least 5 points) than previously described ARDS survivors in the domains of general health, mental health, vitality and social function. One patient had long-term disability as a result of ICU acquired weakness. Only 26\% of survivors had returned to previous work levels at the time of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This ARDS cohort had a high survival rate (86\%) after use of ECMO support for reversible refractory hypoxemia. Long term survivors had similar physical health but decreased mental health, general health, vitality and social function compared to other ARDS survivors and an unexpectedly poor return to work.},

Participants included adult patients hospitalized between March 1 and May 15, 2020, with COVID-19 and not receiving corticosteroids for chronic use. Data were analyzed from October 2021 to March 2022.Corticosteroid exposure was defined as more than 0.5 mg/kg methylprednisolone equivalent in a 24-hour period. For target trial emulation, exposures were corticosteroids for 6 days if and when a patient met criteria for severe hypoxia vs no corticosteroids. For approaches common in clinical literature, treatment definitions used for variables in Cox regression models varied by study design (no time frame, 1 day, and 5 days from time of severe hypoxia).The main outcome was 28-day mortality from time of hospitalization. The association of corticosteroids with mortality for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 was assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) meta-analysis of corticosteroid randomized clinical trials as a benchmark.A total of 3298 patients (median [IQR] age, 65 [53-77] years; 1970 [60\%] men) were assessed, including 423 patients who received corticosteroids at any point during hospitalization and 699 patients who died within 28 days of hospitalization. Target trial emulation analysis found corticosteroids were associated with a reduced 28-day mortality rate, from 32.2\%; (95\% CI, 30.9\%-33.5\%) to 25.7\% (95\% CI, 24.5\%-26.9\%). This estimate is qualitatively identical to the WHO meta-analysis odds ratio of 0.66 (95\% CI, 0.53-0.82). Hazard ratios using methods comparable with current corticosteroid research range in size and direction, from 0.50 (95\% CI, 0.41-0.62) to 1.08 (95\% CI, 0.80-1.47).These findings suggest that clinical research based on observational data can be used to estimate findings similar to those from randomized clinical trials; however, the correctness of these estimates requires designing the study and analyzing the data based on principles that are different from the current standard in clinical research.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: An increasing number of deaths following severe stroke are due to terminal extubations. Variation in withdrawal-of-care practices suggests the possibility of unnecessary prolongation of suffering or of unwanted deaths. OBJECTIVES: To review the available evidence on prognosis in mechanically ventilated stroke patients and to provide an overall framework to optimize decision making for clinicians, patients, and families. DATA SOURCES: Search of MEDLINE from 1980 through March 2005 for English-language articles addressing prognosis in mechanically ventilated stroke patients. From 689 articles identified, we selected 17 for further review. We also identified factors that influence, and decision-making biases that may result, in overuse or underuse of life-sustaining therapies, with a particular emphasis on mechanical ventilation. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overall mortality among mechanically ventilated stroke patients is high, with a 30-day death rate approximating 58\% (range in literature, 46\%-75\%). Although data are limited, among survivors as many as one third may have no or only slight disability, yet many others have severe disability. One can further refine prognosis according to knowledge of stroke syndromes, early patient characteristics, use of clinical prediction rules, and the need for continuing interventions. Factors influencing preferences for life-sustaining treatments include the severity and pattern of future clinical deficits, the probability of these deficits, and the burdens of treatments. Decision-making biases that may affect withdrawal-of-treatment decisions include erroneous prognostic estimates, inappropriate methods of communicating evidence, misunderstanding patient values and expectations, and failing to appreciate the extent to which patients can physically and psychologically adapt. CONCLUSIONS: Although prognosis among mechanically ventilated stroke patients is generally poor, a minority do survive without severe disability. Prognosis can be assessed according to clinical presentation and patient characteristics. There is an urgent need to better understand the marked variation in the care of these patients and to reliably measure and improve the patient-centeredness of such decisions.},

The current understanding of the predictors of functional outcome only in WFNS grade V SAH is limited. Journal Pre-proof Methods: WFNS grade V SAH patients were retrospectively analyzed between April 2008 and August 2019. Surgical treatment is commonly delayed until clinical improvement is observed using a less aggressive approach. Clinical and radiological data on admission were assessed, and disease-related characteristics were compared between patients with favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-3) and those with unfavorable outcomes (mRS 4-6). Results: A total of 144 patients were included, and 22 patients (15.3\%) achieved favorable outcomes, whereas 122 patients (84.7\%) had unfavorable outcomes. Surgical aneurysm repair was performed in all patients with favorable outcomes and in 21.3\% of those with unfavorable outcomes. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that GCS 3, high-grade Early Brain Edema Score (EBES), absence of bilaterally light reflex and neurological improvement, and hypertension were significantly associated with unfavorable outcomes (OR 9.54, P=0.03; OR 5.37, P=0.04; OR 11.80, P=0.009; OR 0.14, P=0.02 and OR 6.53, P=0.04, respectively). Conclusions: The final outcome of patients with WFNS grade V SAH was still poor and highly predicted by GCS score 3, high-grade EBES, absence of bilaterally light reflex and neurological improvement, and a history of hypertension.

This has gone as far as some journals banning the use of indicators for statistical significance, or even any reports of p-values, and, in one case, any mention of confidence intervals. I discuss three of the issues that have led to these often-heated debates. First, I argue that in many cases, p-values and indicators of statistical significance do not answer the questions of primary interest. Such questions typically involve making (recommendations on) decisions under uncertainty. In that case, point estimates and measures of uncertainty in the form of confidence intervals or even better, Bayesian intervals, are often more informative summary statistics. In fact, in that case, the presence or absence of statistical significance is essentially irrelevant, and including them in the discussion may confuse the matter at hand. Second, I argue that there are also cases where testing null hypotheses is a natural goal and where p-values are reasonable and appropriate summary statistics. I conclude that banning them in general is counterproductive. Third, I discuss that the overemphasis in empirical work on statistical significance has led to abuse of p-values in the form of p-hacking and publication bias. The use of pre-analysis plans and replication studies, in combination with lowering the emphasis on statistical significance may help address these problems.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine mRNA booster vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death in the Omicron era by booster type, primary vaccine type, time since primary vaccination, age, and comorbidity burden. DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study designed to emulate a target trial of booster vaccination versus no booster, conducted from 1 December 2021 to 31 March 2022. SETTING: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care system. PARTICIPANTS: Persons who had received 2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses at least 5 months earlier. INTERVENTION: Booster monovalent mRNA vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 or Moderna's mRNA-1273) versus no booster. MEASUREMENTS: Booster VE. RESULTS: Each group included 490~838 well-matched persons, who were predominantly male (88\%), had a mean age of 63.0 years (SD, 14.0), and were followed for up to 121 days (mean, 79.8 days). Booster VE more than 10 days after a booster dose was 42.3\% (95\% CI, 40.6\% to 43.9\%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 53.3\% (CI, 48.1\% to 58.0\%) against SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalization, and 79.1\% (CI, 71.2\% to 84.9\%) against SARS-CoV-2-related death. Booster VE was similar for different booster types (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273), age groups, and primary vaccination regimens but was significantly higher with longer time since primary vaccination and higher comorbidity burden. LIMITATION: Predominantly male population. CONCLUSION: Booster mRNA vaccination was highly effective in preventing death and moderately effective in preventing infection and hospitalization for up to 4 months after administration in the Omicron era. Increased uptake of booster vaccination, which is currently suboptimal, should be pursued to limit the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in persons with high comorbidity burden.

  abstract = {Background Incidental discovery accounts for 30\% of newly-diagnosed intracranial meningiomas. There is no consensus on their optimal management. This review aimed to evaluate the outcomes of different management strategies for these tumors. Methods Using established systematic review methods, six databases were scanned up to September 2017. Pooled event proportions were estimated using a random effects model. Meta-regression of prognostic factors was performed using individual patient data. Results Twenty studies (2130 patients) were included. Initial management strategies at diagnosis were: surgery (27.3\%), stereotactic radiosurgery (22.0\%) and active monitoring (50.7\%) with a weighted mean follow-up of 49.5~months (SD\,=\,29.3). The definition of meningioma growth and monitoring regimens varied widely impeding relevant meta-analysis. The pooled risk of symptom development in patients actively monitored was 8.1\% (95\% CI 2.7--16.1). Associated factors were peritumoral edema (OR 8.72 [95\% CI 0.35--14.90]) and meningioma diameter\,{$\geq$}\,3~cm (OR 34.90 [95\% CI 5.17--160.40]). The pooled proportion of intervention after a duration of active monitoring was 24.8\% (95\% CI 7.5--48.0). Weighted mean time-to-intervention was 24.8~months (SD\,=\,18.2). The pooled risks of morbidity following surgery and radiosurgery, accounting for cross-over, were 11.8\% (95\% CI 3.7--23.5) and 32.0\% (95\% CI 10.6--70.5) respectively. The pooled proportion of operated meningioma being WHO grade I was 94.0\% (95\% CI 88.2--97.9). Conclusion The management of incidental meningioma varies widely. Most patients who clinically or radiologically progressed did so within 5~years of diagnosis. Intervention at diagnosis may lead to unnecessary overtreatment. Prospective data is needed to develop a risk calculator to better inform management strategies.

Design, Setting, and Patients A prospective cohort involving 1194 patients with 1520 hospitalizations for severe sepsis drawn from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative survey of US residents (1998-2006). A total of 9223 respondents had a baseline cognitive and functional assessment and had linked Medicare claims; 516 survived severe sepsis and 4517 survived a nonsepsis hospitalization to at least 1 follow-up survey and are included in the analysis. Main Outcome Measures Personal interviews were conducted with respondents or proxies using validated surveys to assess the presence of cognitive impairment and to determine the number of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs) for which patients needed assistance. Results Survivors' mean age at hospitalization was 76.9 years. The prevalence of moderate to severe cognitive impairment increased 10.6 percentage points among patients who survived severe sepsis, an odds ratio (OR) of 3.34 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-7.25) in multivariable regression. Likewise, a high rate of new functional limitations was seen following sepsis: in those with no limits before sepsis, a mean 1.57 new limitations (95\% CI, 0.99-2.15); and for those with mild to moderate limitations before sepsis, a mean of 1.50 new limitations (95\% CI, 0.87-2.12). In contrast, nonsepsis general hospitalizations were associated with no change in moderate to severe cognitive impairment (OR, 1.15; 95\% CI, 0.80-1.67; P for difference vs sepsis=.01) and with the development of fewer new limitations (mean among those with no limits before hospitalization, 0.48; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.57; P for difference vs sepsis Ͻ.001 and mean among those with mild to moderate limits, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.23-0.63; P for difference=.001). The declines in cognitive and physical function persisted for at least 8 years. Conclusions Severe sepsis in this older population was independently associated with substantial and persistent new cognitive impairment and functional disability among survivors. The magnitude of these new deficits was large, likely resulting in a pivotal downturn in patients' ability to live independently.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine neuropsychological function, depression, and quality of life 6 months after discharge in patients who received mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary care, medical and coronary intensive care unit of a university-based medical center. STUDY POPULATION: A total of 275 consecutive, mechanically ventilated patients from a medical intensive care unit were prospectively followed. At 6 months, 157 were alive, of whom 41 (26\%) returned for extensive follow-up testing. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Neuropsychological testing and assessment of depression and quality of life were performed at 6-month follow-up. Seven of 41 patients were excluded from further analysis due to preexisting cognitive impairment determined via surrogate interviews using the Modified Blessed Dementia Rating Scale and a review of medical records. On the basis of strict criteria derived from normative data, we found that 11 of 34 patients (32\%) were neuropsychologically impaired. Impairment was generally diffuse but occurred primarily in areas of psychomotor speed, visual and working memory, verbal fluency, and visuo-construction. The rate of neuropsychological deficits in the study population was markedly higher than population norms for mild dementia. Scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form were significantly more abnormal in the neuropsychologically impaired group than in the nonimpaired group at hospital discharge (p =.04) and at 6-month follow-up (p =.02), and clinically significant depression was found in 27\% of impaired subjects at hospital discharge and in 36\% at 6-month follow-up. No differences were observed between groups in quality of life as measured with the Short Form Health Survey-12 at discharge or 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged neuropsychological impairment is common among survivors of the medical intensive care unit and occurs with greater than anticipated frequency when compared with relevant normative data. Future investigations are warranted to elucidate the nature of the association between critical illness, neuropsychological impairment, depression, and decreased quality of life.},

  abstract = {New neuroprotective treatments aimed at preventing or minimizing ``delayed brain injury'' are attractive areas of investigation and hold the potential to have substantial beneficial effects on aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) survivors. The underlying mechanisms for this ``delayed brain injury'' are multi-factorial and not fully understood. The most ideal treatment strategies would have the potential for a pleotropic effect positively modulating multiple implicated pathophysiological mechanisms at once. My personal management (RFJ) of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage closely follows those treatment recommendations contained in modern published guidelines. However, over the last 5~years, I have also utilized a novel treatment strategy, originally developed at the University of Maryland, which consists of a 14-day continuous low-dose intravenous heparin infusion (LDIVH) beginning 12~h after securing the ruptured aneurysm. In addition to its well-known anti-coagulant properties, unfractionated heparin has potent anti-inflammatory effects and through multiple mechanisms may favorably modulate the neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory processes prominent in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. In my personal series of patients treated with LDIVH, I have found significant preservation of neurocognitive function as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) compared to a control cohort of my patients treated without LDIVH (RFJ unpublished data presented at the 2015 AHA/ASA International Stroke Conference symposium on neuroinflammation in aSAH and in abstract format at the 2015 AANS/CNS Joint Cerebrovascular Section Annual Meeting). It is important for academic physicians involved in the management of these complex patients to continue to explore new treatment options that may be protective against the potentially devastating ``delayed brain injury'' following cerebral aneurysm rupture. Several of the treatment options included in this review show promise and could be carefully adopted as the level of evidence for each improves. Other proposed neuroprotective treatments like statins and magnesium sulfate were previously thought to be very promising and to varying degrees were adopted at numerous institutions based on somewhat limited human evidence. Recent clinical trials and meta-analysis have shown no benefit for these treatments, and I currently no longer utilize either treatment as prophylaxis in my practice.},

CE is a leading cause of in-hospital mortality, occurring in {$>$}60\% of patients with mass lesions, and {$\sim$}15\% of those with normal initial computed tomography scans. After treatment of mass lesions in severe TBI, an important focus of acute neurocritical care is evaluating and managing the secondary injury process of CE and resultant intracranial hypertension. This review focuses on a contemporary understanding of various pathophysiologic pathways contributing to CE, with a subsequent description of potential targeted therapies. There is a discussion of identified cellular/cytotoxic contributors to CE, as well as mechanisms that influence blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption/vasogenic edema, with the caveat that this distinction may be somewhat artificial since molecular processes contributing to these pathways are interrelated. While an exhaustive discussion of all pathways with putative contributions to CE is beyond the scope of this review, the roles of some key contributors are highlighted, and references are provided for further details. Potential future molecular targets for treating CE are presented based on pathophysiologic mechanisms. We thus aim to provide a translational synopsis of present and future strategies targeting CE after TBI in the context of a paradigm shift towards precision medicine.

Design, Setting, and Patients Retrospective cohort study using the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files from 1997 to 2006. We included all Medicare hospitalizations involving admission to an intensive care unit of an acute care, nonfederal hospital within the continental United States. Main Outcome Measures Overall long-term acute care utilization, associated costs, and survival following transfer. Results The number of long-term acute care hospitals in the United States increased at a mean rate of 8.8\% per year, from 192 in 1997 to 408 in 2006. During that time, the annual number of long-term acute care admissions after critical illness increased from 13 732 to 40 353, with annual costs increasing from \$484 million to \$1.325 billion. The age-standardized population incidence of long-term acute care utilization after critical illness increased from 38.1 per 100 000 in 1997 to 99.7 per 100 000 in 2006, with greater use among male individuals and black individuals in all periods. Over time, transferred patients had higher numbers of comorbidities (5.0 in 19972000 vs 5.8 in 2004-2006, PϽ.001) and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation at the long-term acute care hospital (16.4\% in 1997-2000 vs 29.8\% in 20042006, PϽ.001). One-year mortality after long-term acute care hospital admission was high throughout the study period: 50.7\% in 1997-2000 and 52.2\% in 2004-2006. Conclusions Long-term acute care hospital utilization after critical illness is common and increasing. Survival among Medicare beneficiaries transferred to long-term acute care after critical illness is poor.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data on systolic blood pressure (SBP) trajectories in the first 24 hours after endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in acute ischemic stroke are limited. We sought to identify these trajectories and their relationship to outcomes. METHODS: We combined individual-level data from 5 studies of patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent EVT and had individual blood pressure values after the end of the procedure. We used group-based trajectory analysis to identify the number and shape of SBP trajectories post-EVT. We used mixed effects regression models to identify associations between trajectory groups and outcomes adjusting for potential confounders and reported the respective adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and common odds ratios. RESULTS: There were 2640 total patients with acute ischemic stroke included in the analysis. The most parsimonious model identified 4 distinct SBP trajectories, that is, general directional patterns after repeated SBP measurements: high, moderatehigh, moderate, and low. Patients in the higher blood pressure trajectory groups were older, had a higher prevalence of vascular risk factors, presented with more severe stroke syndromes, and were less likely to achieve successful recanalization after the EVT. In the adjusted analyses, only patients in the high-SBP trajectory were found to have significantly higher odds of early neurological deterioration (aOR, 1.84 [95\% CI, 1.20--2.82]), intracranial hemorrhage (aOR, 1.84 [95\% CI, 1.31--2.59]), mortality (aOR, 1.75 [95\% CI, 1.21--2.53), death or disability (aOR, 1.63 [95\% CI, 1.15--2.31]), and worse functional outcomes (adjusted common odds ratio,1.92 [95\% CI, 1.47--2.50]). CONCLUSIONS: Patients follow distinct SBP trajectories in the first 24 hours after an EVT. Persistently elevated SBP after the procedure is associated with unfavorable short-term and long-term outcomes. (Hypertension. 2024;81:00--00.

In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to compare the efficacy and safety outcomes of intravenous tenecteplase to intravenous alteplase administration for acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs). Methods: We searched MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) and Scopus for published randomized controlled clinical trials providing outcomes of acute ischemic stroke with confirmed LVO receiving intravenous thrombolysis with either tenecteplase at different doses or alteplase at a standard dose of 0.9 mg/kg. The primary outcome was the odds of modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 at 3 months. Results: We included 4 randomized controlled clinical trials including a total of 433 patients. Patients with confirmed LVO receiving tenecteplase had higher odds of modified Rankin Scale scores of 0 to 2 (odds ratio, 2.06 [95\% CI, 1.15--3.69]), successful recanalization (odds ratio, 3.05 [95\% CI, 1.73--5.40]), and functional improvement defined as 1-point decrease across all modified Rankin Scale grades (common odds ratio, 1.84 [95\% CI, 1.18--2.87]) at 3 months compared with patients with confirmed LVO receiving alteplase. There was little or no heterogeneity between the results provided from included studies regarding the aforementioned outcomes (I2{$\leq$}20\%). No difference in the outcomes of early neurological improvement, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, any intracranial hemorrhage, and the rates of modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1 or all-cause mortality at 3 months was detected between patients with LVO receiving intravenous thrombolysis with either tenecteplase or alteplase. Conclusions: Acute ischemic stroke patients with LVO receiving intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase have significantly better recanalization and clinical outcomes compared with patients receiving intravenous alteplase.},

  abstract = {The use of evidence from clinical trials to support decisions for individual patients is a form of ``reference class forecasting'': implicit predictions for an individual are made on the basis of outcomes in a reference class of ``similar'' patients treated with alternative therapies. Evidence based medicine has generally emphasized the broad reference class of patients qualifying for a trial. Yet patients in a trial (and in clinical practice) differ from one another in many ways that can affect the outcome of interest and the potential for benefit. The central goal of personalized medicine, in its various forms, is to narrow the reference class to yield more patient specific effect estimates to support more individualized clinical decision making. This article will review fundamental conceptual problems with the prediction of outcome risk and heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE), as well as the limitations of conventional (one-variable-at-a-time) subgroup analysis. It will also discuss several regression based approaches to ``predictive'' heterogeneity of treatment effect analysis, including analyses based on ``risk modeling'' (such as stratifying trial populations by their risk of the primary outcome or their risk of serious treatment-related harms) and analysis based on ``effect modeling'' (which incorporates modifiers of relative effect). It will illustrate these approaches with clinical examples and discuss their respective strengths and vulnerabilities.},

Recruitment was conducted between September 2009 and July 2016 at 19 US sites comprising 42 hospitals. Control participants were identified through random digit dialing and were matched to case participants by age ({\textpm}5 years), sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic area. Data analyses were conducted from January 2019 to May 2020.Case and control participants underwent a standardized interview, physical measurement for body mass index, and genotyping for the {$\varepsilon$}2 and {$\varepsilon$}4 alleles of APOE, the gene encoding apolipoprotein E. Prevalence, multivariable adjusted odds ratio (OR), and PAR percentage were calculated for each risk factor in the entire ICH population and stratified by racial/ethnic group and by lobar or nonlobar location.There were 1000 Black patients (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 57 [50-65] years, 425 [42.5\%] women), 1000 Hispanic patients (median [IQR] age, 58 [49-69] years; 373 [37.3\%] women), and 1000 White patients (median [IQR] age, 71 [59-80] years; 437 [43.7\%] women). The mean (SD) age of patients with ICH was significantly lower among Black and Hispanic patients compared with White patients (eg, lobar ICH: Black, 62.2 [15.2] years; Hispanic, 62.5 [15.7] years; White, 71.0 [13.3] years). More than half of all ICH in Black and Hispanic patients was associated with treated or untreated hypertension (PAR for treated hypertension, Black patients: 53.6\%; 95\% CI, 46.4\%-59.8\%; Hispanic patients: 46.5\%; 95\% CI, 40.6\%-51.8\%; untreated hypertension, Black patients: 45.5\%; 95\% CI, 39.\%-51.1\%; Hispanic patients: 42.7\%; 95\% CI, 37.6\%-47.3\%). Lack of health insurance also had a disproportionate association with the PAR percentage for ICH in Black and Hispanic patients (Black patients: 21.7\%; 95\% CI, 17.5\%-25.7\%; Hispanic patients: 30.2\%; 95\% CI, 26.1\%-34.1\%; White patients: 5.8\%; 95\% CI, 3.3\%-8.2\%). A high sleep apnea risk score was associated with both lobar (OR, 1.68; 95\% CI, 1.36-2.06) and nonlobar (OR, 1.62; 95\% CI, 1.37-1.91) ICH, and high cholesterol was inversely associated only with nonlobar ICH (OR, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.52-0.70); both had no interactions with race and ethnicity. In contrast to the association between the {$\varepsilon$}2 and {$\varepsilon$}4 alleles of APOE and ICH in White individuals (eg, presence of APOE {$\varepsilon$}2 allele: OR, 1.84; 95\% CI, 1.34-2.52), APOE alleles were not associated with lobar ICH among Black or Hispanic individuals.This study found sleep apnea as a novel risk factor for ICH. The results suggest a strong contribution from inadequately treated hypertension and lack of health insurance to the disproportionate burden and earlier onset of ICH in Black and Hispanic populations. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing modifiable risk factors and the social determinants of health to reduce health disparities.},

A better understanding of long-term health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is needed. Objective: To synthesize research on long-term (at least 6 months post-ECMO) HRQOL of adults treated with ECMO. Methods: In this integrative review, we searched 3 electronic databases and did a hand search of relevant journals for articles published 2000--2019, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Thirty-one studies, representing 913 patients treated with ECMO, were included. Long-term HRQOL was slightly better for patients treated with veno-venous ECMO than veno-arterial ECMO, and mental health outcomes tended to be better than physical ones. Survivors frequently experienced physical complications, functional limitations, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms, although improvements were observed over time. Conclusions: Early identification and management of physical and mental health problems may improve HRQOL outcomes.},

  abstract = {Trials often assess primary outcomes of traumatic brain injury at 6 months. Longer-term data are needed to assess outcomes for patients receiving surgical vs medical treatment for traumatic intracranial hypertension.To evaluate 24-month outcomes for patients with traumatic intracranial hypertension treated with decompressive craniectomy or standard medical care.Prespecified secondary analysis of the Randomized Evaluation of Surgery With Craniectomy for Uncontrollable Elevation of Intracranial Pressure (RESCUEicp) randomized clinical trial data was performed for patients with traumatic intracranial hypertension (\&gt;25 mm Hg) from 52 centers in 20 countries. Enrollment occurred between January 2004 and March 2014. Data were analyzed between 2018 and 2021. Eligibility criteria were age 10 to 65 years, traumatic brain injury (confirmed via computed tomography), intracranial pressure monitoring, and sustained and refractory elevated intracranial pressure for 1 to 12 hours despite pressure-controlling measures. Exclusion criteria were bilateral fixed and dilated pupils, bleeding diathesis, or unsurvivable injury.Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a decompressive craniectomy with standard care (surgical group) or to ongoing medical treatment with the option to add barbiturate infusion (medical group).The primary outcome was measured with the 8-point Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (1 indicates death and 8 denotes upper good recovery), and the 6- to 24-month outcome trajectory was examined.This study enrolled 408 patients: 206 in the surgical group and 202 in the medical group. The mean (SD) age was 32.3 (13.2) and 34.8 (13.7) years, respectively, and the study population was predominantly male (165 [81.7\%] and 156 [80.0\%], respectively). At 24 months, patients in the surgical group had reduced mortality (61 [33.5\%] vs 94 [54.0\%]; absolute difference, -20.5 [95\% CI, -30.8 to -10.2]) and higher rates of vegetative state (absolute difference, 4.3 [95\% CI, 0.0 to 8.6]), lower or upper moderate disability (4.7 [-0.9 to 10.3] vs 2.8 [-4.2 to 9.8]), and lower or upper severe disability (2.2 [-5.4 to 9.8] vs 6.5 [1.8 to 11.2]; {$\chi$}27\,=\,24.20, P\,=\,.001). For every 100 individuals treated surgically, 21 additional patients survived at 24 months; 4 were in a vegetative state, 2 had lower and 7 had upper severe disability, and 5 had lower and 3 had upper moderate disability, respectively. Rates of lower and upper good recovery were similar for the surgical and medical groups (20 [11.0\%] vs 19 [10.9\%]), and significant differences in net improvement ({$\geq$}1 grade) were observed between 6 and 24 months (55 [30.0\%] vs 25 [14.0\%]; {$\chi$}22\,=\,13.27, P\,=\,.001).At 24 months, patients with surgically treated posttraumatic refractory intracranial hypertension had a sustained reduction in mortality and higher rates of vegetative state, severe disability, and moderate disability. Patients in the surgical group were more likely to improve over time vs patients in the medical group.ISRCTN Identifier: 66202560},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE{\enspace} Outcome analysis of comatose patients (Hunt and Hess Grade V) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is still lacking. The aims of this study were to analyze the outcome of Hunt and Hess Grade V SAH and to compare outcomes in the current period with those of the pre--International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) era as well as with published data from trials of decompressive craniectomy (DC) for middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction. METHODS{\enspace} The authors analyzed cases of Hunt and Hess Grade V SAH from 1980--1995 (referred to in this study as the earlier period) and 2005--2014 (current period) and compared the results for the 2 periods. The outcomes of 257 cases were analyzed and stratified on the basis of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores obtained 6 months after SAH. Outcomes were dichotomized as favorable (mRS score of 0--2) or unfavorable (mRS score of 3--6). Data and number needed to treat (NNT) were also compared with the results of decompressive craniectomy (DC) trials for middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarctions. RESULTS{\enspace} Early aneurysm treatment within 72 hours occurred significantly more often in the current period (in 67\% of cases vs 22\% in earlier period). In the earlier period, patients had a significantly higher 30-day mortality rate (83\% vs 39\% in the current period) and 6-month mortality rate (94\% vs 49\%), and no patient (0\%) had a favorable outcome, compared with 23\% overall in the current period (p {$<$} 0.01, OR 32), or 29.5\% of patients whose aneurysms were treated (p {$<$} 0.01, OR 219). Cerebral infarctions occurred in up to 65\% of the treated patients in the current period. Comparison with data from DC MCA trials showed that the NNTs were significantly lower in the current period with 2 for survival and 3 for mRS score of 0--3 (vs 3 and 7, respectively, for the DC MCA trials). CONCLUSIONS{\enspace} Early and aggressive treatment resulted in a significant improvement in survival rate (NNT = 2) and favorable outcome (NNT = 3 for mRS score of 0--3) for comatose patients with Hunt and Hess Grade V SAH compared with the earlier period. Independent predictors for favorable outcome were younger age and bilateral intact corneal reflexes. Despite a high rate of cerebral infarction (65\%) in the current period, 29.5\% of the patients who received treatment for their aneurysms during the current era (2005--2014) had a favorable outcome. However, careful individual decision making is essential in these cases. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2016.8.JNS161075 KEY WORDS{\enspace} subarachnoid hemorrhage; Hunt and Hess Grade V; severe SAH; clinical outcome; prognostic factors; stroke trials; coma; vascular disorders},

  abstract = {Background Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) before mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for large-vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke is increasingly controversial. Recent trials suggest MT without IVT is reasonable for patients presenting directly to MT-capable ``hub'' centers. However, bypassing IVT has not been evaluated for patients presenting to IVT-capable ``spoke'' hospitals that require hub transfer for MT. A perceived lack of efficacy of IVT to result in LVO early recanalization (ER) is often cited to support bypassing IVT, but data for IVT in patients who require interhospital transfer are limited. Here, we examined LVO ER rates after spoke-administered IVT in our hub-and-spoke stroke network. Methods Patients presenting to 25 spokes before hub transfer for MT consideration from 2018 to 2020 were retrospectively identified from a prospectively maintained database. Inclusion criteria were pretransfer computed tomography angiography--defined LVO, Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score {$\geq$}6, and posttransfer repeat vessel imaging. Results Of 167 patients, median age was 69, and 51\% were women. Seventy-six received spoke IVT, and 91 did not. Alteplase was the only IVT used in this study. Comorbidities and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale were similar between groups. ER frequency was increased 7.2-fold in patients who received spoke IVT (12/76 [15.8\%] versus 2/91 [2.2\%]; P{$<$}0.001]. Spoke-administered IVT was independently associated with ER (adjusted odds ratio, =11.5 [95\% CI, 2.2--99.6; P{$<$}0.05) after adjusting for the timing of~last known well, interhospital transfer, and repeat vessel imaging. Interval National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was improved in patients with ER (median -2 [interquartile range, -6.3 to -0.8] versus 0 [-2.5 to 1]; P{$<$}0.05). Conclusion Within our network, patients who received spoke IVT had a 7.2-fold increased ER relative likelihood. This real-world analysis supports IVT use in eligible patients with LVO at spoke hospitals before hub transfer for MT.},

They provide evidence-based recommendations for healthcare professionals in daily clinical settings. MPGs help patients and practitioners make informed decisions, ensure quality of care, allocate healthcare resources effectively and reduce legal liability.

They define the standard of care within the healthcare industry and provide best practice recommendations. MPGs are a cornerstone of the informed consent process, as they facilitate a shared decision support system and they provide valuable evidence-based recommendations on various treatments or medical options. Finally, MPGs are also relevant in medical claims; thus, adherence to MPGs is highly encouraged in order to assure the best medical care. Nonetheless, MPGs have limitations and we advocate for wise usage of MPGs combined with the expertise of trained physicians that allows for individualisation and evidence-based recommendations. In this review, we describe the potential legal implications that MPGs may represent for healthcare providers and the role that MPGs have in daily practice at different stages in the doctor--patient relationship.},

On the other hand, Bayesian methods for data analysis have not yet made much headway in cognitive science against the institutionalized inertia of 20th century null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Ironically, specific Bayesian models of cognition and perception may not long endure the ravages of empirical verification, but generic Bayesian methods for data analysis will eventually dominate. It is time that Bayesian data analysis became the norm for empirical methods in cognitive science. This article reviews a fatal flaw of NHST and introduces the reader to some benefits of Bayesian data analysis.

  abstract = {In critical care, the specific, structured approach to patient care known as a ``time-limited trial'' has been promoted in the literature to help patients, surrogate decision makers, and clinicians navigate consequential decisions about life-sustaining therapy in the face of uncertainty. Despite promotion of the time-limited trial approach, a lack of consensus about its definition and essential elements prevents optimal clinical use and rigorous evaluation of its impact. The objectives of this American Thoracic Society Workshop Committee were to establish a consensus definition of a time-limited trial in critical care, identify the essential elements for conducting a time-limited trial, and prioritize directions for future work. We achieved these objectives through a structured search of the literature, a modified Delphi process with 100 interdisciplinary and interprofessional stakeholders, and iterative committee discussions. We conclude that a time-limited trial for patients with critical illness is a collaborative plan among clinicians and a patient and/or their surrogate decision maker(s) to use life-sustaining therapy for a defined duration, after which the patient's response to therapy informs the decision to continue care directed towards recovery, transition to care focused exclusively on comfort, or extend the trial's duration. The plan's 16 essential elements follow four sequential phases: consider, plan, support, reassess. We acknowledge considerable gaps in evidence about the impact of timelimited trials and highlight a concern that, if inadequately implemented, time-limited trials may perpetuate unintended harm. Future work is needed to better implement this defined, specific approach to care in practice through a person-centered equity lens and to evaluate its impact on patients, surrogates, and clinicians.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the extent of hospital and intensive-care use at the end of life is well known, patterns of surgical care during this period are poorly understood. We examined national patterns of surgical care in the USA among elderly fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in their last year of life. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study of elderly beneficiaries of fee-for-service Medicare in the USA, aged 65 years or older, who died in 2008. We identified claims for inpatient surgical procedures in the year before death and examined the relation between receipt of an inpatient procedure and both age and geographical region. We calculated an end-of-life surgical intensity (EOLSI) score for each hospital referral region defined as proportion of decedents who underwent a surgical procedure during the year before their death, adjusted for age, sex, race, and income. We compared patient characteristics with Rao-Scott {$\chi$}(2) tests, resource use with generalised estimating equations, regional differences with generalised estimating equations Wald tests, and end-of-life surgical intensity scores with Spearman's partial-rank-order correlation coefficients. FINDINGS: Of 1,802,029 elderly beneficiaries of fee-for-service Medicare who died in 2008, 31{$\cdot$}9\% (95\% CI 31{$\cdot$}9-32{$\cdot$}0; 575,596 of 1,802,029) underwent an inpatient surgical procedure during the year before death, 18{$\cdot$}3\% (18{$\cdot$}2-18{$\cdot$}4; 329,771 of 1,802,029) underwent a procedure in their last month of life, and 8{$\cdot$}0\% (8{$\cdot$}0-8{$\cdot$}1; 144,162 of 1,802,029) underwent a procedure during their last week of life. Between the ages of 80 and 90 years, the percentage of decedents undergoing a surgical procedure in the last year of life decreased by 33\% (35{$\cdot$}3\% [95\% CI 34{$\cdot$}7-35{$\cdot$}9; 8858 of 25,094] to 23{$\cdot$}6\% [22{$\cdot$}9-24{$\cdot$}3; 3340 of 14,152]). EOLSI score in the highest intensity region (Munster, IN) was 34{$\cdot$}4 (95\% CI 33{$\cdot$}7-35{$\cdot$}1) and in the lowest intensity region (Honolulu, HI) was 11{$\cdot$}5 (11{$\cdot$}3-11{$\cdot$}7). Regions with a high number of hospital beds per head had high end-of-life surgical intensity (r=0{$\cdot$}37, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}27-0{$\cdot$}46; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), as did regions with high total Medicare spending (r=0{$\cdot$}50, 0{$\cdot$}41-0{$\cdot$}58; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). INTERPRETATION: Many elderly people in the USA undergo surgery in the year before their death. The rate at which they undergo surgery varies substantially with age and region and might suggest discretion in health-care providers' decisions to intervene surgically at the end of life. FUNDING: None.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Black and Hispanic Americans have a greater risk of primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) than whites. Deep ICH is most often associated with hypertension, while lobar ICH is associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The authors conducted a population-based incidence study to directly compare the incidence of deep vs lobar ICH in all three race-ethnic groups. METHODS: The authors used an active hospital and community surveillance program and autopsy reports to identify incident ICH cases among white, black, and Caribbean Hispanic adults in Northern Manhattan between July 1993 and June 1997. Incidence rates were adjusted for age and sex to the 1990 US Census. CIs for risk ratios (RR) were calculated with Byar's chi2 approximation of the Poisson distribution. RESULTS: The authors identified 155 cases of ICH for an annual incidence of 30.9/100,000 (26.7 to 35.0). Men had a higher risk of ICH than women (RR 1.5, 95\% CI 1.2 to 1.8), driven entirely by the incidence of deep ICH (RR 1.8) rather than lobar ICH (RR 1.0). Compared with whites, RR for blacks was all ICH 3.8 (2.2 to 8.9), deep 4.8 (2.3 to 21.1), lobar 2.8 (1.2 to 14.4); RR for Hispanics was all 2.6 (1.4 to 6.1), deep 3.7 (1.7 to 16.5), lobar 1.4 (0.4 to 7.4). CONCLUSIONS: ICH is a heterogeneous disease with deep and lobar subtypes distinguishable on an epidemiologic basis. The different patterns of these two subtypes in our race-ethnically diverse population lend credence to the notion that ICH should no longer be treated as a single entity.},

  abstract = {Following intensive care unit hospitalization, survivors of acute neurological injury often experience debilitating short-term and long-term impairments. Although the physical/motor impairments experienced by survivors of acute neurological injury have been described extensively, fewer studies have examined cognitive, mental health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and employment outcomes. This scoping review describes the publication landscape beyond physical and/or motor sequelae in neurocritical care survivors. Databases were searched for terms related to critical illness, intensive care, and outcomes from January 1970 to March 2022. English-language studies of critically ill adults with a primary neurological diagnosis were included if they reported on at least one outcome of interest: cognition, mental health, HRQoL or employment. Data extraction was performed in duplicate for prespecified variables related to study outcomes. Of 16,036 abstracts screened, 74 citations were identified for inclusion. The studies encompassed seven worldwide regions and eight neurocritical diagnosis categories. Publications reporting outcomes of interest increased from 3 before the year 2000 to 71 after. Follow-up time points included\,{$\leq$}\,1 (n\,=\,15 [20\%] citations), 3 (n\,=\,28 [38\%]), 6 (n\,=\,28 [38\%]), and 12 (n\,=\,21 [28\%]) months and 1 to 5 (n\,=\,19 [26\%]) and\,{$>$}\,5~years (n\,=\,8 [11\%]), with 28 (38\%) citations evaluating outcomes at multiple time points. Sixty-six assessment tools were used to evaluate the four outcomes of interest: 22 evaluating HRQoL (56 [76\%] citations), 21 evaluating cognition (20 [27\%] citations), 21 evaluating mental health (18 [24\%] citations), and 2 evaluating employment (9 [12\%] citations). This scoping review aimed to better understand the literature landscape regarding nonphysical outcomes in survivors of neurocritical care. Although a rising number of publications highlight growing awareness, future efforts are needed to improve study consistency and comparability and characterize outcomes in a disease-specific manner, including outlining of a minimum core outcomes set and associated assessment tools.},

At present, reserving hypothermia for patients without predictors of poor prognosis seems open to criticism.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elders undergo approximately 40\% of more than 1 million major abdominal operations annually. Yet evidence about recovery to preoperative levels of functional independence is limited. This study details course and predictors of functional recovery after elective major abdominal operations in the elderly. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort of 372 consecutive patients, 60 years old or more, enrolled from surgeons in private practice and two university-affiliated hospitals, assessed preoperatively and postoperatively at 1, 3, and 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, using self-report and performance-based measures (Activities of Daily Living [ADL], Instrumental Activities of Daily Living [IADL], Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Physical Component and Mental Component Scales [PCS, MCS], Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS], Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam [MMSE], timed walk, functional reach, hand grip strength). RESULTS: Mean age was 69 +/- 6 years with 56\% men, 47\% nonHispanic Caucasian, and 42\% Mexican American; hospital distribution was 49\% private, 51\% university-affiliated. Maximum functional declines (95\% CI) occurred 1 week postoperatively: ADL, 2.8 points (2.4 to 3.2); IADL, 7.6 points (7 to 8.3); SF-36 PCS, 6.5 points (5.4 to 7.6); Mini-Mental State Exam, 0.5 points (0.2 to 0.7); timed walk, 6.8 seconds (5.2 to 8.4); functional reach, 1.7 inches (1.2 to 2.2); grip strength, 2 kilograms (1.3 to 2.7) (p {$<$} 0.001 for all). SF-36 mental component scale and Geriatric Depression Scale scores did not worsen. Mean recovery times were: Mini-Mental State Exam, 3 weeks; timed walk, 6 weeks; ADL, SF-36 PCS, and functional reach, 3 months; and IADL, 6 months. Mean grip strength did not return to preoperative status by 6 months. The incidence of persistent disability at 6 months, compared with preoperative status, was: ADL, 9\%; IADL, 19\%; PCS, 16\%; mental component scale, 17\%; timed walk, 39\%; functional reach, 58\%; and grip strength, 52\%. Potentially modifiable independent predictors of ADL and IADL recovery were preoperative physical conditioning and depression plus serious postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of functional recovery varied across different measures. Protracted disability at 6 months after operation was substantial. Several potentially modifiable factors consistently predicted recovery.},

Perihematomal edema (PHE) accumulates during the first 72~h after hemorrhage, and during this period, patients are at risk of clinical deterioration due to the resulting tissue shifts and brain herniation. First-line medical therapies for patients symptomatic of PHE include osmotic agents, such as mannitol in low- or high-dose bolus form, or boluses of hypertonic saline (HTS) at varied concentrations with or without subsequent continuous infusion. Decompressive craniectomy may be required for symptomatic edema refractory to osmotherapy. Other strategies that reduce PHE such as hypothermia and minimally invasive surgery have shown promise in pilot studies and are currently being evaluated in larger clinical trials. Ongoing basic, translational, and clinical research seek to better elucidate the pathophysiology of PHE to identify novel strategies to prevent edema formation as a next major advance in the treatment of ICH.},

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the Korean Hypothermia Network Pro registry. SETTING: Multicenter ICU. PATIENTS: Adult ({$\geq$} 18 yr) comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors who underwent targeted temperature management at 33--36{$^\circ$}C between October 2015 and December 2018. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured the time from the end of rewarming to awakening, defined as a total Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than or equal to 9 or Glasgow Coma Scale motor score equals to 6. The primary outcome was awakening time. The secondary outcome was 6-month neurologic outcomes (poor outcome: Cerebral Performance Category 3--5). Among 1,145 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors, 477 patients (41.7\%) regained consciousness 30 hours (6--71\,hr) later, and 116 patients (24.3\%) awakened late (72\,hr after the end of rewarming). Young age, witnessed arrest, shockable rhythm, cardiac etiology, shorter time to return of spontaneous circulation, lower serum lactate level, absence of seizures, and multisedative requirement were associated with awakening. Of the 477 who woke up, 74 (15.5\%) had poor neurologic outcomes. Older age, liver cirrhosis, nonshockable rhythm, noncardiac etiology, a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and higher serum lactate levels were associated with poor neurologic outcomes. Late awakeners were more common in the poor than in the good neurologic outcome group (38/74 [51.4\%] vs 78/403 [19.4\%]; p {$<$} 0.001). The awakening time (odds ratio, 1.005; 95\% CIs, 1.003--1.008) and late awakening (odds ratio, 3.194; 95\% CIs, 1.776--5.746) were independently associated with poor neurologic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Late awakening after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was common in no withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy settings and the probability of awakening decreased over time.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose--- Patients with right hemispheric strokes (RHSs) present later to an emergency department, have a lower chance to receive intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rt-PA), and have worse clinical outcomes than do patients with left hemispheric strokes (LHSs). We analyzed outcomes after IV rt-PA with respect to the side of the affected hemisphere. Methods--- A prospective cohort of acute stroke patients was treated with IV rt-PA at the London Health Sciences Centre (December 1998 to March 2003). Differences between patients with RHS and LHS were identified by univariate analysis. Logistic-regression analysis was used to determine a subset of variables independently associated with major neurological improvement at 24 hours and good outcome at 3 months after treatment. Results--- Of 219 stroke patients who received IV rt-PA, 165 had hemispheric strokes (68 RHSs and 97 LHSs). Patients with RHSs were less hypertensive (P=0.001) and had lower pretreatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (P=0.005). LHS (odds ratio [OR], 2.29; 95\% CI, 1.14 to 4.59; P=0.019), age (OR, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.93 to 0.99; P=0.012), and pretreatment NIHSS (OR, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.78 to 0.89; P{$<$}0.0001) were independent predictors of 3-month outcome. Female sex (OR, 3; 95\% CI, 1.53 to 5.90; P=0.001) and LHS (OR, 2.07; 95\% CI, 1.05 to 4.08; P=0.03) were independent predictors of major neurological improvement at 24 hours after IV rt-PA. Conclusions--- Despite higher pretreatment NIHSS, patients with LHSs have a 2-fold increased chance of a good outcome 3 months after rt-PA treatment compared with patients with RHSs. This gain can be clinically detected at 24 hours after treatment. These results need to be coupled with neuroimaging and hemodynamic characteristics known to influence stroke outcome.},

  abstract = {\ding{51} To determine what factors predict outcome, the authors retrospectively reviewed the management of all 159 poor-grade patients admitted to Harborview Medical Center at the University of Washington who suffered aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage between 1983 and 1993. Favorable outcome (assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale) occurred in 53.9\% of Hunt and Hess Grade IV, and 24.1\% of Grade V patients. Outcome was largely determined by the initial hemorrhage and subsequent development of intractable intracranial hypertension or cerebral infarction. Using multivariate analysis, the authors developed three models to predict outcome. It was found that predicting outcome based only on clinical and diagnostic criteria present at admission may have resulted in withholding treatment from 30\% of the patients who subsequently experienced favorable outcomes. It is concluded that aggressive management including surgical aneurysm obliteration can benefit patients with poor neurological grades and should not be denied solely on the basis of the neurological condition on admission.},

Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to explore the association between lateralization and stroke-related complications and clinical outcomes., Results: A total of 314 patients with LHI were enrolled, with 171 (54.5\%) having right hemispheric involvement. Right-sided patients with LHI had lower baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (18 vs. 22, p {$<$} 0.001), higher frequency of atrial fibrillation (69.0 vs. 52.4\%, p = 0.003), and higher proportion of cardio-embolism (73.1 vs. 56.6\%, p = 0.013) than the left. Right-sided LHI had higher incidence rates of malignant brain edema (MBE) (48.5 vs. 30.8\%, p = 0.001) and a composite of cardiovascular events (29.8 vs. 17.5\%, p = 0.011) during hospitalization. The incidence rate of 1-month mortality (34.5 vs. 23.8\%, p = 0.036) was higher in right-sided patients with LHI, but there were no hemispheric differences in the incidence rates of 3-month mortality and unfavorable outcome (both p {$>$} 0.05). Multivariate analyses suggested right hemisphere involvement was independently associated with increased risk of MBE (adjusted OR 2.37, 95\% CI 1.26--4.43, p = 0.007) and composite of cardiovascular events (adjusted OR 2.04, 95\% CI 1.12--3.72, p = 0.020). However, it was not independently associated with 1-month death, 3-month mortality, and 3-month unfavorable outcome (all p {$>$} 0.05)., Conclusions: Right-sided patients with LHI had higher frequency of atrial fibrillation and cardio-embolism than the left-sided patients. Right hemisphere involvement was independently associated with increased risk of MBE and composite of cardiovascular events during hospitalization, whereas stroke lateralization was not an independent predictor of mortality and unfavorable outcome in patients with LHI.},

  abstract = {Balanced crystalloids may improve outcomes compared with saline for some critically ill adults. Lower tonicity of balanced crystalloids could worsen cerebral edema in patients with intracranial pathology. The effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on clinical outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) requires further study. We planned an a priori subgroup analysis of TBI patients enrolled in the pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02444988, NCT02547779). Primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital discharge disposition (home, facility, death). Regression models adjusted for pre-specified baseline covariates compared outcomes. TBI patients assigned to balanced crystalloids (n\,=\,588) and saline (n\,=\,569) had similar baseline characteristics including Injury Severity Score 19 (10); mean maximum head/neck Abbreviated Injury Score, 3.4 (1.0). Isotonic crystalloid volume administered between intensive care unit admission and first of hospital discharge or 30 days was 2037 (3470) mL and 1723 (2923) mL in the balanced crystalloids and saline groups, respectively (p\,=\,0.18). During the study period, 94 (16\%) and 82 (14\%) patients (16\%) died in the balanced crystalloid and saline groups, respectively (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.03; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 1.75; p\,=\,0.913). Patients in the balanced crystalloid group were more likely to die or be discharged to another medical facility (aOR 1.38 [1.02-1.86]; p\,=\,0.04). Overall, balanced crystalloids were associated with worse discharge disposition in critically injured patients with TBI compared with saline. The confidence intervals cannot exclude a clinically relevant increase in mortality when balanced crystalloids are used for patients with TBI.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To determine whether uninsured critically ill patients had differences in 30-day mortality and critical care service use compared with those with private insurance and to determine if outcome variability could be attributed to patient-level or hospital-level effects. Methods: Retrospective cohort study using Pennsylvania hospital discharge data with detailed clinical risk adjustment, from fiscal years 2005 and 2006, consisting of 167 general acute care hospitals, with 138,720 critically ill adult patients 64 years of age or younger. Measurements and Main Results: Measurements were 30-day mortality and receipt of five critical care procedures. Uninsured patients had an absolute 30-day mortality of 5.7\%, compared with 4.6\% for those with private insurance and 6.4\% for those with Medicaid. Increased 30-day mortality among uninsured patients persisted after adjustment for patient characteristics (odds ratio [OR], 1.25 for uninsured vs. insured; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.04--1.50) and hospital-level effects (OR, 1.26; 95\% CI, 1.05--1.51). Compared with insured patients, uninsured patients had decreased risk-adjusted odds of receiving a central venous catheter (OR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.72--0.97), acute hemodialysis (OR, 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.39--0.91), and tracheostomy (OR, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.29--0.64). Conclusions: Lack of health insurance is associated with increased 30-day mortality and decreased use of common procedures for the critically ill in Pennsylvania. Differences were not attributable to hospital-level effects, suggesting that the uninsured have a higher mortality and receive fewer procedures when compared with privately insured patients treated at the same hospitals.},

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia, with 50 to 60\% of all dementias attributable to AD alone, while the rest are mostly due to frontotemporal lobar dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, and vascular dementia. Diagnosis of dementias is made clinically with the aid of other testing modalities including neuroimaging. While the role of imaging has traditionally been to exclude reversible causes of dementia, positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-fluorine fluorodeoxyglucose and magnetic resonance imaging now are increasingly used more for definitive diagnosis of dementia in the prodromal stages and to aid with formulating the differential diagnoses. Introduction of molecular imaging modalities such as amyloid PET and tau PET have improved diagnostic certainty in the clinical trial setting and promise to find their way into the clinic in the near future. In this review, we will focus on the multimodality imaging of dementias especially AD and its differential diagnoses.},

METHODS               The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of prospective data from a nationwide multicenter registry of all aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) cases admitted to a tertiary care neurosurgical department in Switzerland in the years 2009--2015 (Swiss Study on Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage [Swiss SOS]). Patterns of care and outcomes at discharge and the 1-year follow-up in MCA aneurysm (MCAA) patients were analyzed and compared with those in a control group of patients with IAs in locations other than the MCA (non-MCAA patients). Independent predictors of a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score {$\leq$} 3) were identified, and their effect size was determined.                                         RESULTS               Among 1866 consecutive aSAH patients, 413 (22.1\%) harbored an MCAA. These MCAA patients presented with higher World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grades (p = 0.007), showed a higher rate of concomitant intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH; 41.9\% vs 16.7\%, p {$<$} 0.001), and experienced delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) more frequently (38.9\% vs 29.4\%, p = 0.001) than non-MCAA patients. After adjustment for confounders, patients with MCAA were as likely as non-MCAA patients to experience DCI (aOR 1.04, 95\% CI 0.74--1.45, p = 0.830). Surgical treatment was the dominant treatment modality in MCAA patients and at a significantly higher rate than in non-MCAA patients (81.7\% vs 36.7\%, p {$<$} 0.001). An MCAA location was a strong independent predictor of surgical treatment (aOR 8.49, 95\% CI 5.89--12.25, p {$<$} 0.001), despite statistical adjustment for variables traditionally associated with surgical treatment, such as (space-occupying) ICH (aOR 1.73, 95\% CI 1.23--2.45, p = 0.002). Even though MCAA patients were less likely to die during the acute hospitalization (aOR 0.52, 0.30--0.91, p = 0.022), their rate of a favorable outcome was lower at discharge than that in non-MCAA patients (55.7\% vs 63.7\%, p = 0.003). At the 1-year follow-up, 68.5\% and 69.6\% of MCAA and non-MCAA patients, respectively, had a favorable outcome (p = 0.676).                                         CONCLUSIONS               Microsurgical occlusion remains the predominant treatment choice for about 80\% of ruptured MCAAs in a European industrialized country. Although patients with MCAAs presented with worse admission grades and greater rates of concomitant ICH, in-hospital mortality was lower and long-term disability was comparable to those in patients with non-MCAA.},

Recent progress focused on those manuscripts that were published within the past 5 years. Results Perhaps the most exciting new findings that speak to both the control of production and resolution of edema in both trauma and ischemia are the recent studies that have focused on the newly described ``water channels'' or aquaporins. Other important findings relate to the predominance of cellular edema in TBI. Conclusions Significant new findings have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of brain edema; however, less progress has been made in treatment. Aquaporin water channels offer hope for modulating and abating the devastating effects of fulminating brain edema in trauma and stroke.},

Methods: All adults who experienced OHCA VF in Olmsted County, MN, from 1990 to 2008, survived more than 6 months postarrest, and were alive at the time of study recruitment were invited to participate in structured neuropsychological testing and a neurologic examination. Cognitive test results were compared to the normal population using the Mayo's Older Adults Normative Studies. Linear regression models were fit to evaluate each neuropsychological test result in relation to call-to-shock time, sex, age at cardiac arrest, time elapsed since event, witnessed vs unwitnessed arrest, and administration of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Results: Of 332 OHCA VF arrests, 140 people (42.2\%, 95\% confidence interval 36.9\%--47.5\%) survived to discharge. No patient entered a minimally conscious or permanent vegetative state. Long-term survivors (n ϭ 47, median survival 7.8 years postarrest) had lower scores on measures of long-term memory and learning efficiency (p ϭ 0.001) but higher than average scores on verbal IQ (p ϭ 0.001). Nearly all survivors were functionally independent and scored high on the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) (median Barthel Index 100/100, median MMSE 29/30). Conclusions: Long-term survivors of OHCA VF have long-term memory deficits compared to the normal population at the same age and education level. These findings provide a baseline for cognitive outcomes studies of OHCA VF as new techniques are developed to improve survival. Neurology{\textregistered} 2011;77:1438--1445},

  abstract = {therapy, pharmacologic management, and neuromodulation approaches for treatment-resistant OCD, are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS  OCD affects 2\% to 3\% of adults worldwide and is associated with substantial individual disability and societal costs. Lack of recognition of common OCD symptom types, in addition to shame and fear of stigma on the part of patients, has created an average delay in diagnosis by almost 10 years and a delay in effective treatment (ie, a treatment gap) of nearly 2 years. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically a form of CBT that includes a type of behavioral intervention called exposure and response prevention, remains the most effective form of treatment for OCD. If CBT is not effective or not available, pharmacologic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or clomipramine, a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, can also be of benefit. Neuromodulation approaches such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation are rapidly emerging as effective treatments for OCD, particularly for patients who have not experienced an adequate response to psychotherapy or pharmacologic management. SUMMARY  OCD affects more than one in every 50 adults in the United States but is recognized and adequately treated in fewer than half of those affected. Early intervention and appropriate treatment can substantially reduce OCD symptom severity, improve quality of life, and minimize the functional disability associated with this chronic and often debilitating illness....},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To prospectively assess outcomes in major areas of life function at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months after msTBI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study, as part of the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) study, was conducted at 18 level 1 trauma centers in the US from February 2014 to August 2018 and prospectively assessed longitudinal outcomes, with follow-up to 12 months postinjury. Participants were patients with msTBI (Glasgow Coma Scale scores 3-12) extracted from a larger group of patients with mild, moderate, or severe TBI who were enrolled in TRACK-TBI. Data analysis took place from October 2019 to April 2021. EXPOSURES Moderate or severe TBI. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The Glasgow Outcome Scale--Extended (GOSE) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) were used to assess global functional status 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Scores on the GOSE were dichotomized to determine favorable (scores 4-8) vs unfavorable (scores 1-3) outcomes. Neurocognitive testing and patient reported outcomes at 12 months postinjury were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 484 eligible patients were included from the 2679 individuals in the TRACK-TBI study. Participants with severe TBI (n = 362; 283 men [78.2\%]; median [interquartile range] age, 35.5 [25-53] years) and moderate TBI (n = 122; 98 men [80.3\%]; median [interquartile range] age, 38 [25-53] years) were comparable on demographic and premorbid variables. At 2 weeks postinjury, 36 of 290 participants with severe TBI (12.4\%) and 38 of 93 participants with moderate TBI (41\%) had favorable outcomes (GOSE scores 4-8); 301 of 322 in the severe TBI group (93.5\%) and 81 of 103 in the moderate TBI group (78.6\%) had moderate disability or worse on the DRS (total score Ն4). By 12 months postinjury, 142 of 271 with severe TBI (52.4\%) and 54 of 72 with moderate TBI (75\%) achieved favorable outcomes. Nearly 1 in 5 participants with severe TBI (52 of 270 [19.3\%]) and 1 in 3 with moderate TBI (23 of 71 [32\%]) reported no disability (DRS score 0) at 12 months. Among participants in a vegetative state at 2 weeks, 62 of 79 (78\%) regained consciousness and 14 of 56 with available data (25\%) regained orientation by 12 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, patients with msTBI frequently demonstrated major functional gains, including recovery of independence, between 2 weeks and 12 months postinjury. Severe impairment in the short term did not portend poor outcomes in a substantial minority of patients with msTBI. When discussing prognosis during the first 2 weeks after injury, clinicians should be particularly cautious about making early, definitive prognostic statements suggesting poor outcomes and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in patients with msTBI.},

There are few studies assessing the interrater reliability of the mFS. Methods:{\enspace} We distributed a survey to a convenience sample with snowball sampling of practicing neurointensivists and through the research survey portion of the Neurocritical Care Society Web site. The survey consisted of 15 scrollable CT scans of patients with SAH for mFS grading, two questions regarding the definitions of the scale criteria and demographics of the responding physician. Kendall's coefficient of concordance was used to determine the interrater reliability of mFS grading. Results:{\enspace} Forty-six participants (97.8\% neurocritical care fellowship trained, 78\% UCNS-certified in neurocritical care, median 5 years (IQR 3--6.3) in practice, treating median of 80 patients (IQR 50--100) with SAH annually from 32 institutions) completed the survey. By mFS criteria, 30\% correctly identified that there is no clear measurement of thin versus thick blood, and 42\% correctly identified that blood in any ventricle is scored as ``intraventricular blood.''The overall interrater reliability by Kendall's coefficient of concordance for the mFS was moderate (W\,=\,0.586, p\,{$<$}\,0.0005). Conclusions:{\enspace} Agreement among raters in grading the mFS is only moderate. Online training tools could be developed to improve mFS reliability and standardize research in SAH.},

The association of intravenous alteplase treatment and thrombus characteristics with recanalization over time is important for stroke triage and future trial design.To examine recanalization over time across a range of intracranial thrombus occlusion sites and clinical and imaging characteristics in patients with ischemic stroke treated with intravenous alteplase or not treated with alteplase.Multicenter prospective cohort study of 575 patients from 12 centers (in Canada, Spain, South Korea, the Czech Republic, and Turkey) with acute ischemic stroke and intracranial arterial occlusion demonstrated on computed tomographic angiography (CTA).Demographics, clinical characteristics, time from alteplase to recanalization, and intracranial thrombus characteristics (location and permeability) defined on CTA.Recanalization on repeat CTA or on first angiographic acquisition of affected intracranial circulation obtained within 6 hours of baseline CTA, defined using the revised arterial occlusion scale (rAOL) (scores from 0 [primary occlusive lesion remains the same] to 3 [complete revascularization of primary occlusion]).Among 575 patients (median age, 72 years [IQR, 63-80]; 51.5\% men; median time from patient last known well to baseline CTA of 114 minutes [IQR, 74-180]), 275 patients (47.8\%) received intravenous alteplase only, 195 (33.9\%) received intravenous alteplase plus endovascular thrombectomy, 48 (8.3\%) received endovascular thrombectomy alone, and 57 (9.9\%) received conservative treatment. Median time from baseline CTA to recanalization assessment was 158 minutes (IQR, 79-268); median time from intravenous alteplase start to recanalization assessment was 132.5 minutes (IQR, 62-238). Successful recanalization occurred at an unadjusted rate of 27.3\% (157/575) overall, including in 30.4\% (143/470) of patients who received intravenous alteplase and 13.3\% (14/105) who did not (difference, 17.1\% [95\% CI, 10.2\%-25.8\%]). Among patients receiving alteplase, the following factors were associated with recanalization: time from treatment start to recanalization assessment (OR, 1.28 for every 30-minute increase in time [95\% CI, 1.18-1.38]), more distal thrombus location, eg, distal M1 middle cerebral artery (39/84 [46.4\%]) vs internal carotid artery (10/92 [10.9\%]) (OR, 5.61 [95\% CI, 2.38-13.26]), and higher residual flow (thrombus permeability) grade, eg, hairline streak (30/45 [66.7\%]) vs none (91/377 [24.1\%]) (OR, 7.03 [95\% CI, 3.32-14.87]).In patients with acute ischemic stroke, more distal thrombus location, greater thrombus permeability, and longer time to recanalization assessment were associated with recanalization of arterial occlusion after administration of intravenous alteplase; among patients who did not receive alteplase, rates of arterial recanalization were low. These findings may help inform treatment and triage decisions in patients with acute ischemic stroke.},

Methods---                PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched until March 2016. Quality assessment was done by 2 authors independently. Pooled prevalence ratios and pooled odds ratios with 95\% confidence intervals were calculated for data extracted from case--control studies.                                            Results---                We included 208 papers. The incidence of perimesencephalic hemorrhage is {$\approx$}0.5 per 100.000 person-years, men are more often affected, and no risk factors were confirmed. Two decision analyses both found that a single, high-quality computed tomography angiography is the preferred diagnostic approach. Short-term complications, such as hydrocephalus or cranial nerve palsies, are rare, and usually transient, with the exception of acute symptomatic hydrocephalus necessitating treatment in 3\% of patients. Lacunar infarcts in the brain stem were convincingly described in 4 patients only. Fatal rebleeding after installment of anticoagulation in the initial days after the hemorrhage was described in 1 patient. At long-term follow-up, death related to the hemorrhage has not been reported, disability is found in 0\% to 6\%, and neuropsychological sequelae are suggested.                                            Conclusions---                A single, high-quality computed tomography angiography is the preferred diagnostic strategy. Short-term complications are rare and often transient. Long-term outcome is excellent with respect to disability and death, but high-quality studies focused at neuropsychological sequelae are needed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the futility of lower SBP targets after endovascular therapy ({$<$}140 mm Hg or 160 mm Hg) compared with a higher target (Յ180 mm Hg). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, open-label, blinded end point, phase 2, futility clinical trial that enrolled 120 patients with acute ischemic stroke who had undergone successful endovascular therapy at 3 US comprehensive stroke centers from January 2020 to March 2022 (final follow-up, June 2022). INTERVENTION After undergoing endovascular therapy, participants were randomized to 1 of 3 SBP targets: 40 to less than 140 mm Hg, 40 to less than 160 mm Hg, and 40 to 180 mm Hg or less (guideline recommended) group, initiated within 60 minutes of recanalization and maintained for 24 hours. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prespecified multiple primary outcomes for the primary futility analysis were follow-up infarct volume measured at 36 ({\textpm}12) hours and utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score (range, 0 [worst] to 1 [best]) at 90 ({\textpm}14) days. Linear regression models were used to test the harm-futility boundaries of a 10-mL increase (slope of 0.5) in the follow-up infarct volume or a 0.10 decrease (slope of -0.005) in the utility-weighted mRS score with each 20-mm Hg SBP target reduction after endovascular therapy (1-sided {$\alpha$} = .05). Additional prespecified futility criterion was a less than 25\% predicted probability of success for a future 2-group, superiority trial comparing SBP targets of the low- and mid-thresholds with the highthreshold (maximum sample size, 1500 with respect to the utility-weighted mRS score outcome). RESULTS Among 120 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 69.6 [14.5] years; 69 females [58\%]), 113 (94.2\%) completed the trial. The mean follow-up infarct volume was 32.4 mL (95\% CI, 18.0 to 46.7 mL) for the less than 140--mm Hg group, 50.7 mL (95\% CI, 33.7 to 67.7 mL), for the less than 160--mm Hg group, and 46.4 mL (95\% CI, 24.5 to 68.2 mL) for the 180--mm Hg or less group. The mean utility-weighted mRS score was 0.51 (95\% CI, 0.38 to 0.63) for the less than 140--mm Hg group, 0.47 (95\% CI, 0.35 to 0.60) for the less than 160--mm Hg group, and 0.58 (95\% CI, 0.46 to 0.71) for the high-target group. The slope of the follow-up infarct volume for each mm Hg decrease in the SBP target, adjusted for the baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score, was -0.29 (95\% CI, -0.81 to {$\varrho$}; futility P = .99). The slope of the utility-weighted mRS score for each mm Hg decrease in the SBP target after endovascular therapy, adjusted for baseline utility-weighted mRS score, was -0.0019 (95\% CI, -{$\varrho$} to 0.0017; futility P = .93). Comparing the high-target SBP group with the lower-target groups, the predicted probability of success for a future trial was 25\% for the less than 140--mm Hg group and 14\% for the 160--mm Hg group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with acute ischemic stroke, lower SBP targets less than either 140 mm Hg or 160 mm Hg after successful endovascular therapy did not meet prespecified criteria for futility compared with an SBP target of 180 mm Hg or less. However, the findings suggested a low probability of benefit from lower SBP targets after endovascular therapy if tested in a future larger trial.},

  abstract = {Background Whether the composition of intravenous crystalloid solutions affects outcomes in adults with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) remains unknown. Therefore, we determined whether the use of saline is associated with a lower risk of disability and death in patients with aSAH compared with balanced crystalloids. Methods We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of SMART (Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial), a pragmatic, unblinded, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover clinical trial that enrolled 15~802 adults between June 2015 and April 2017. We compared IV administration of saline to balanced crystalloids in consecutively enrolled patients with aSAH aged 18 years or older whose ruptured aneurysm was procedurally secured at a single academic center in the United States. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 [no symptoms]--6 [death]) at 90~days obtained from a prospective institutional stroke registry. Secondary outcome included death by 90~days. Logistic or proportional odds regression models were used to test for between-group differences adjusted for age, hypertension, aSAH grade, and procedure type. Results Of the 79 patients with aSAH procedurally treated during the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial study period, 78 were enrolled (median age, 58 years; interquartile range, 49--64.5; 64\% female), with 41 (53\%) assigned to saline and 37 (47\%) to balanced crystalloids. Plasma-Lyte was the primary balanced crystalloid used. Among 72 patients with 90-day modified Rankin scale assessment, the adjusted common odds ratio, for the modified Rankin scale was 0.68 (95\% CI, 0.28--1.63; P=0.39), with values {$<$}1.0 favoring saline. By 90~days, 2/39 patients (5\%) in the saline group and 9/35 (26\%) in the balanced-crystalloids group had died (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.06; 95\% CI, 0.00--0.50; P=0.02). Conclusions Among procedurally treated patients with aSAH, the risk of disability or death at 90~days did not significantly differ between saline and balanced crystalloids. Death occurred less frequently with saline than balanced crystalloids.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The practice of platelet transfusion to mitigate the deleterious effects of antiplatelet agents on spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains common. However, the effect of antiplatelet agents on patients with ICH is still controversial and transfusing platelets is not without risk. We performed a meta-analysis in order to determine the effect of platelet transfusion on antiplatelet agent associated ICH. METHODS: We queried PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases to identify cohort studies, case-control studies, and randomized control trials. Study quality was graded by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, as appropriate. Outcomes of interest included functional independence as measured by the modified Rankin Scale and mortality. We compared patients with antiplatelet agent associated ICH who received platelet transfusion to those that did not. RESULTS: We identified 625 articles. After reviewing 44 full text articles, 5 were deemed appropriate for meta-analysis, including 4 cohort studies and one randomized control trial. Considerable heterogeneity was present among the studies (I2~{$>~$}81\% for all analyses). We did not find a significant effect of platelet transfusions on functional independence (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.3, 95\% CI.0.45-3.9) or mortality (OR 0.58, 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.12-2.6). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence for an effect of platelet transfusions on functional independence or mortality following antiplatelet associated ICH. More randomized trials are needed to evaluate platelet transfusion in patients with ICH and proven reduced platelet activity or those requiring neurosurgical intervention.},

  abstract = {the most common and potentially life-threatening neurologic and medical complications to promote their early recognition and prevent secondary brain injury. RECENT FINDINGS  Over the past 30 years, the incidence of SAH has remained stable; yet, likely because of improved care in specialized neurocritical care units, discharge mortality has considerably decreased. Two consensus guidelines by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association and the Neurocritical Care Society have outlined best practices for the management of patients with SAH. The most important recommendations include admission of patients to high-volume centers (defined as more than 35 SAH admissions per year) under the management of a multidisciplinary, specialized team; expeditious identification and treatment of the bleeding source with evaluation by a multidisciplinary team consisting of cerebrovascular neurosurgeons, neuroendovascular specialists, and neurointensivists; management of patients in a neurocritical care unit with enteral nimodipine, blood pressure control, euvolemia, and close monitoring for neurologic and medical complications; and treatment of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm/delayed cerebral ischemia with induced hypertension and endovascular therapies. This article also highlights new insights of SAH pathophysiology and provides updates in the management approach. SUMMARY  SAH remains a neurologic emergency. Management of patients with SAH includes adherence to published guidelines, but some areas of SAH management remain understudied. Clinical trials are required to elucidate the role of these controversial management approaches in improving patient outcomes....},

A primary feature of DAGs is their acyclic nature, which for causal DAGs means variables cannot have direct or indirect effects on their own parent variables occurring before them in time. This is often taken to mean that DAGs cannot display ``feedback loops'' where two variables inform each other over time, and thus that the utility of DAGs for displaying complex biological relationship is limited. These ``feedback loops,'' hereafter referred to as bidirectional effects, are common in epidemiological, biological, and psychological research and do pose a major challenge for researchers aiming to incorporate DAGs into their research process. However, this challenge does not arise from a violation of the underlying temporality of causation but rather from a need to clearly specify how causal relationships evolve over time. In this article, we explain how to approach bidirectional relationships in DAGs and discuss considerations and strategies for using DAGs when bidirectional effects are present in research areas.},

  abstract = {Background: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) vasculopathy produces stroke secondary to viral infection of cerebral arteries. Not all patients have rash before cerebral ischemia or stroke. Furthermore, other vasculitides produce similar clinical features and comparable imaging, angiographic, and CSF abnormalities. Methods: We review our 23 published cases and 7 unpublished cases of VZV vasculopathy. All CSFs were tested for VZV DNA by PCR and anti-VZV IgG antibody and were positive for either or both. Results: Among 30 patients, rash occurred in 19 (63\%), CSF pleocytosis in 20 (67\%), and imaging abnormalities in 29 (97\%). Angiography in 23 patients revealed abnormalities in 16 (70\%). Large and small arteries were involved in 15 (50\%), small arteries in 11 (37\%), and large arteries in only 4 (13\%) of 30 patients. Average time from rash to neurologic symptoms and signs was 4.1 months, and from neurologic symptoms and signs to CSF virologic analysis was 4.2 months. CSF of 9 (30\%) patients contained VZV DNA while 28 (93\%) had anti-VZV IgG antibody in CSF; in each of these patients, reduced serum/CSF ratio of VZV IgG confirmed intrathecal synthesis. Conclusions: Rash or CSF pleocytosis is not required to diagnose varicella zoster virus (VZV) vasculopathy, whereas MRI/CT abnormalities are seen in almost all patients. Most patients had mixed large and small artery involvement. Detection of anti-VZV IgG antibody in CSF was a more sensitive indicator of VZV vasculopathy than detection of VZV DNA (p Ͻ 0.001). Determination of optimal antiviral treatment and benefit of concurrent steroid therapy awaits studies with larger case numbers. Neurology{\textregistered} 2008;70:853--860},

It included 306 patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke treated with EVT and with a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b or greater (partial or complete reperfusion).Participants were randomly assigned to receive intensive BP management (systolic BP target \&lt;140 mm Hg; n\,=\,155) or conventional management (systolic BP target 140-180 mm Hg; n\,=\,150) for 24 hours after enrollment.The primary outcome was functional independence at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2). The primary safety outcomes were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage within 36 hours and death related to the index stroke within 3 months.The trial was terminated early based on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board, which noted safety concerns. Among 306 randomized patients, 305 were confirmed eligible and 302 (99.0\%) completed the trial (mean age, 73.0 years; 122 women [40.4\%]). The intensive management group had a lower proportion achieving functional independence (39.4\%) than the conventional management group (54.4\%), with a significant risk difference (-15.1\% [95\% CI, -26.2\% to -3.9\%]) and adjusted odds ratio (0.56 [95\% CI, 0.33-0.96]; P\,=\,.03). Rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage were 9.0\% in the intensive group and 8.1\% in the conventional group (risk difference, 1.0\% [95\% CI, -5.3\% to 7.3\%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.10 [95\% CI, 0.48-2.53]; P\,=\,.82). Death related to the index stroke within 3 months occurred in 7.7\% of the intensive group and 5.4\% of the conventional group (risk difference, 2.3\% [95\% CI, -3.3\% to 7.9\%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.73 [95\% CI, 0.61-4.92]; P\,=\,.31).Among patients who achieved successful reperfusion with EVT for acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion, intensive BP management for 24 hours led to a lower likelihood of functional independence at 3 months compared with conventional BP management. These results suggest that intensive BP management should be avoided after successful EVT in acute ischemic stroke.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04205305},

In this comment, I discuss some of these issues from a scientific perspective. What goal does model selection serve when all models are known to be systematically wrong? How might ``toy problems'' tell a misleading story? How does the scientific goal of explanation align with (or differ from) traditional statistical concerns?

  abstract = {Purpose:{\enspace} Patients who are successfully resuscitated following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are still at a high risk of neurological damage and death. Inflammation and brain injury are components of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome, and can be assessed by systemic interleukin 6 (IL-6) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). Anti-inflammatory treatment with methylprednisolone may dampen inflammation, thereby improving outcome. This study aimed to determine if prehospital high-dose methylprednisolone could reduce IL-6 and NSE in comatose OHCA patients. Methods:{\enspace} The STEROHCA trial was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II prehospital trial performed at two cardiac arrest centers in Denmark. Resuscitated comatose patients with suspected cardiac etiology were randomly assigned 1:1 to a single intravenous injection of 250 mg methylprednisolone or placebo. The co-primary outcome was reduction of IL-6 and NSE-blood levels measured daily for 72 h from admission. The main secondary outcome was survival at 180 days follow-up. Results:{\enspace} We randomized 137 patients to methylprednisolone (n\,=\,68) or placebo (n\,=\,69). We found reduced IL-6 levels (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) in the intervention group, with median (interquartile range, IQR) levels at 24 h of 2.1 pg/ml (1.0; 7.1) and 30.7 pg/ml (14.2; 59) in the placebo group. We observed no difference between groups in NSE levels (p\,=\,0.22), with levels at 48 h of 18.8 ug/L (14.4; 24.6) and 14.8 ug/L (11.2; 19.4) in the intervention and placebo group, respec-tively. In the intervention group, 51 (75\%) patients survived and 44 (64\%) in the placebo group. Conclusion:{\enspace} Prehospital treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone to resuscitated comatose OHCA patients, resulted in reduced IL-6 levels after 24 h, but did not reduce NSE levels.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To report the ESICM consensus and clinical practice recommendations on fluid therapy in neurointensive care patients. DESIGN: A consensus committee comprising 22 international experts met in October 2016 during ESICM LIVES2016. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussions between the members of the committee subsequently served to discuss and develop the consensus process. METHODS: Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were reviewed and updated as needed, and evidence profiles generated. The consensus focused on three main topics: (1) general fluid resuscitation and maintenance in neurointensive care patients, (2) hyperosmolar fluids for intracranial pressure control, (3) fluid management in delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid haemorrhage. After an extensive literature search, the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system were applied to assess the quality of evidence (from high to very low), to formulate treatment recommendations as strong or weak, and to issue best practice statements when applicable. A modified Delphi process based on the integration of evidence provided by the literature and expert opinions-using a sequential approach to avoid biases and misinterpretations-was used to generate the final consensus statement. RESULTS: The final consensus comprises a total of 32 statements, including 13 strong recommendations and 17 weak recommendations. No recommendations were provided for two statements. CONCLUSIONS: We present a consensus statement and clinical practice recommendations on fluid therapy for neurointensive care patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Survivors of critical illness often have a prolonged and disabling form of cognitive impairment that remains inadequately characterized. METHODS We enrolled adults with respiratory failure or shock in the medical or surgical intensive care unit (ICU), evaluated them for in-hospital delirium, and assessed global cognition and executive function 3 and 12 months after discharge with the use of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (population age-adjusted mean [{\textpm}SD] score, 100{\textpm}15, with lower values indicating worse global cognition) and the Trail Making Test, Part B (population age-, sex-, and education-adjusted mean score, 50{\textpm}10, with lower scores indicating worse executive function). Associations of the duration of delirium and the use of sedative or analgesic agents with the outcomes were assessed with the use of linear regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS Of the 821 patients enrolled, 6\% had cognitive impairment at baseline, and delirium developed in 74\% during the hospital stay. At 3 months, 40\% of the patients had global cognition scores that were 1.5 SD below the population means (similar to scores for patients with moderate traumatic brain injury), and 26\% had scores 2 SD below the population means (similar to scores for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease). Deficits occurred in both older and younger patients and persisted, with 34\% and 24\% of all patients with assessments at 12 months that were similar to scores for patients with moderate traumatic brain injury and scores for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, respectively. A longer duration of delirium was independently associated with worse global cognition at 3 and 12 months (P\,=\,0.001 and P\,=\,0.04, respectively) and worse executive function at 3 and 12 months (P\,=\,0.004 and P\,=\,0.007, respectively). Use of sedative or analgesic medications was not consistently associated with cognitive impairment at 3 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS Patients in medical and surgical ICUs are at high risk for long-term cognitive impairment. A longer duration of delirium in the hospital was associated with worse global cognition and executive function scores at 3 and 12 months.

  abstract = {Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an increasingly diagnosed condition, but the trends in TBI visits and the cost of which have not been quantified from the hospital perspective. Objectives: To quantify the costs of TBI stratified by inpatient and outpatient visits and to examine trends in TBI incidence over time. Methods: This descriptive study utilized data for 2007-2012 from the Premier hospital database, which includes clinical and utilization information from hospitals across the United States. TBI was identified through International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Descriptive data were obtained to identify the TBI costs, visit costs, patient characteristics, and intertemporal trends in TBI rates. Results: TBI patients were treated on an outpatient basis 88\% of the time. Nearly 45\% (44.3\%) of TBI patients requiring inpatient admissions were age 65 or over, and 20\% of TBI patients treated as an outpatient were age 75 or over. Children aged 4 or younger accounted for nearly 14\% of TBI cases treated on an outpatient basis. TBI patients treated in the inpatient setting incurred fairly long hospital visits (mean 4.8 days; median 3.0 days) and substantial hospital costs (mean \$12,717; median \$8,176). The rate of TBI visits have risen substantially over time, especially among children under age 18 years and patients in the Northeast US Census Region. Conclusion: TBI is a serious medical condition that appears to be on the rise. Large differences exist between the hospital costs associated with TBIs treated in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Further research to understand factors affecting the costs and clinical outcomes of TBI can help refine treatment strategies to enhance patient outcomes while providing cost effective care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Left-sided strokes are reported to be more common than right-sided strokes, but it is unknown whether they occur more often or are simply recognized more easily by clinicians. In a large unselected community-dwelling population, we examined the frequency of clinical left- and right-sided strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and compared it with the frequency of left- and right-sided infarcts on MRI. METHODS: This study was conducted within the population-based Rotterdam Study. Between 1990 and 2012, 13 894 participants were followed up for first-ever stroke and TIA. MRI scans were performed within a random subgroup of 5081 persons and were rated for the presence of supratentorial cortical and lacunar infarcts. We compared frequencies of left- and right-sided strokes, TIAs, or MRI infarcts using binomial and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 9.6 ({\textpm}6.0) years, 1252 patients had a stroke, of which 704 were ischemic, and 799 participants had a TIA. Within the subgroup with MRI, we identified 673 infarcts. Ischemic strokes were more frequently left-sided (57.7\%; 95\% confidence interval, 53.7-61.6) than right-sided, similar to TIAs (57.8\% left-sided; 53.4-62.3). In contrast, we found no left-right difference in distribution of infarcts on MRI (51.9\% left-sided; 48.1-55.6). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical ischemic strokes and TIAs are more frequently left-sided than right-sided, whereas this difference is not present for infarcts on MRI. This suggests that left-sided strokes and TIAs are more easily recognized. Consequently, there should be more attention for symptoms of right-sided strokes and TIAs.},

  abstract = {Objectives:~         To describe the sources of uncertainty in prognosticating devastating brain injury, the role of the intensivist in prognostication, and ethical considerations in prognosticating devastating brain injury in the ICU.         Data Sources:~         A PubMed literature review was performed.         Study Selection:~         Articles relevant to prognosis in intracerebral hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and postcardiac arrest anoxic encephalopathy were selected.         Data Extraction:~         Data regarding definition and prognosis of devastating brain injury were extracted. Themes related to how clinicians perform prognostication and their accuracy were reviewed and extracted.         Data Synthesis:~         Although there are differences in pathophysiology and therefore prognosis in the various etiologies of devastating brain injury, some common themes emerge. Physicians tend to have fairly good prognostic accuracy, especially in severe cases with poor prognosis. Full supportive care is recommended for at least 72 hours from initial presentation to maximize the potential for recovery and minimize secondary injury. However, physician approaches to the timing of and recommendations for withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy have a significant impact on mortality from devastating brain injury.         Conclusions:~         Intensivists should consider the modern literature describing prognosis for devastating brain injury and provide appropriate time for patient recovery and for discussions with the patient's surrogates. Surrogates wish to have a prognosis enumerated even when uncertainty exists. These discussions must be handled with care and include admission of uncertainty when it exists. Respect for patient autonomy remains paramount, although physicians are not required to provide inappropriate medical therapies.},

  abstract = {Background{\enspace}Acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) is associated with significant acute mortality. It is unclear whether later mortality is predominantly driven by preexisting comorbid disease, the acute inciting event or is the result of AHRF itself. Methods{\enspace} Observational cohort study of elderly US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) participants in fee-for-service Medicare (1998--2012). Patients hospitalised with AHRF were matched 1:1 to otherwise similar adults who were not currently hospitalised and separately to patients hospitalised with acute inciting events (pneumonia, non-pulmonary infection, aspiration, trauma, pancreatitis) that may result in AHRF, here termed at-risk hospitalisations. The primary outcome was late mortality---death in the 31 days to 2 years following hospital admission. Results{\enspace}Among 15\,075\,HRS participants, we identified 1268 AHRF and 13\,117 at-risk hospitalisations. AHRF hospitalisations were matched to 1157 non-hospitalised adults and 1017 at-risk hospitalisations. Among patients who survived at least 30 days, AHRF was associated with a 24.4\% (95\%CI 19.9\% to 28.9\%, p{$<$}0.001) absolute increase in late mortality relative to adults not currently hospitalised and a 6.7\% (95\%CI 1.7\% to 11.7\%, p=0.01) increase relative to adults hospitalised with acute inciting event(s) alone. At-risk hospitalisation explained 71.2\% of the increased odds of late mortality, whereas the development of AHRF itself explained 28.8\%. Risk for death was equivalent to at-risk hospitalisation beyond 90\,days, but remained elevated for more than 1\,year compared with non-hospitalised controls. Conclusions{\enspace}In this national sample of older Americans, approximately one in four survivors with AHRF had a late death not explained by pre-AHRF health status. More than 70\% of this increased risk was associated with hospitalisation for acute inciting events, while 30\% was associated with hypoxemic respiratory failure.},

Methods: We summarized evidence addressing four ``PICO questions'' (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations. Results: We suggest the use of: 1) corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), 2) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), 3) neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and 4) higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty), and 5) we recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty). Conclusions: We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision making and implementation of these recommendations while additional evidence is generated from much-needed clinical trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Limited data are available to guide the choice of a target for the systolic blood-pressure level when treating acute hypertensive response in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. METHODS We randomly assigned eligible participants with intracerebral hemorrhage (volume, {$<$}60 cm3) and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 5 or more (on a scale from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating worse condition) to a systolic blood-pressure target of 110 to 139 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or a target of 140 to 179 mm Hg (standard treatment) in order to test the superiority of intensive reduction of systolic blood pressure to standard reduction; intravenous nicardipine to lower blood pressure was administered within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. The primary outcome was death or disability (modified Rankin scale score of 4 to 6, on a scale ranging from 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 3 months after randomization, as ascertained by an investigator who was unaware of the treatment assignments. RESULTS Among 1000 participants with a mean ({\textpm}SD) systolic blood pressure of 200.6{\textpm}27.0 mm Hg at baseline, 500 were assigned to intensive treatment and 500 to standard treatment. The mean age of the patients was 61.9 years, and 56.2\% were Asian. Enrollment was stopped because of futility after a prespecified interim analysis. The primary outcome of death or disability was observed in 38.7\% of the participants (186 of 481) in the intensive-treatment group and in 37.7\% (181 of 480) in the standard-treatment group (relative risk, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.27; analysis was adjusted for age, initial GCS score, and presence or absence of intraventricular hemorrhage). Serious adverse events occurring within 72 hours after randomization that were considered by the site investigator to be related to treatment were reported in 1.6\% of the patients in the intensive-treatment group and in 1.2\% of those in the standard-treatment group. The rate of renal adverse events within 7 days after randomization was significantly higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (9.0\% vs. 4.0\%, P\,=\,0.002).

  abstract = {Objective: Isotonic saline is the most commonly used crystalloid in the ICU, but recent evidence suggests that balanced fluids like Lactated Ringer's solution may be preferable. We examined the association between choice of crystalloids and in-hospital mortality during the resuscitation of critically ill adults with sepsis. Design: A retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with sepsis, not undergoing any surgical procedures, and treated in an ICU by hospital day 2. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding and compared the following outcomes after resuscitation with balanced versus with no-balanced fluids: in-hospital mortality, acute renal failure with and without dialysis, and hospital and ICU lengths of stay. We also estimated the \-dose-response relationship between receipt of increasing proportions of balanced fluids and in-hospital mortality. Setting: Three hundred sixty U.S. hospitals that were members of the Premier Healthcare alliance between November 2005 and December 2010. Patients: A total of 53,448 patients with sepsis, treated with vasopressors and crystalloids in an ICU by hospital day 2 including 3,396 (6.4\%) that received balanced fluids. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Patients treated with balanced fluids were younger and less likely to have heart or chronic renal failure, but they were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation, invasive monitoring, colloids, steroids, and larger crystalloid volumes (median 7 vs 5\,L). Among 6,730 patients in a p\- ropensity-matched cohort, receipt of balanced fluids was associated with lower inhospital mortality (19.6\% vs 22.8\%; relative risk, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.78, 0.94). Mortality was progressively lower among patients receiving larger proportions of balanced fluids. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of acute renal failure (with and without dialysis) or in-hospital and ICU lengths of stay. Conclusions: Among critically ill adults with sepsis, resuscitation with balanced fluids was associated with a lower risk of in-hospital mortality. If confirmed in randomized trials, this finding could have significant public health implications, as crystalloid resuscitation is nearly universal in sepsis. (Crit Care Med 2014; 42:1585--1591)},

Patients:~         Two-hundred thirty-seven consecutive nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage patients admitted to the neurologic ICU between 2010 and 2016.         Interventions:~         Total daily amount of fluids and fluid balance were calculated over 15 days. Using multivariate generalized estimating equation models the association of daily fluid intake and fluid balance with disease severity, hospital complications and poor functional outcome (3-mo modified Rankin Score {$\geq$} 3) was investigated. Additionally, we described the composition of fluids given.         Measurements and Main Results:~         Patients presented with a median admission Hunt and Hess grade of 3 (interquartile range, 1--5) and were 57 years old (interquartile range, 47--67 yr old). A higher daily fluid intake was associated with higher admission Hunt and Hess grade (odds ratio, 1.61; 95\% CI, 1.47--1.76; p {$<$} 0.001), increased pulmonary fluid accumulation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.01--1.21; p = 0.033), prolonged mechanical ventilation (Wald statistic = 20.08; degrees of freedom = 1; p {$<$} 0.001), higher daily Subarachnoid hemorrhage Early Brain Edema Score (adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.01--1.22; p = 0.034), occurrence of anemia (adjusted odds ratio, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.20--1.54; p {$<$} 0.001), delayed cerebral ischemia (adjusted odds ratio, 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.14--1.51; p {$<$} 0.001), and poor functional outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25; 95\% CI, 1.10--1.41; p {$<$} 0.001).

The main contributors to fluids were nutritional compounds (31\%), IV drugs (30\%), and volume substitution (17\%).         Conclusions:~         Our study demonstrates a significant association of fluid intake but not fluid balance with hospital complications and poor functional outcome in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients.

In addition, we performed an extensive within-manuscript search using a specialized Java application. Details of reporting on Bayesian statistics were examined in the original research papers with primary Bayesian data analyses. Results The number of studies in which Bayesian techniques were used for primary data analysis remains constant over the years. Though many authors presented thorough descriptions of the analyses they performed and the results they obtained, several reports presented incomplete method sections and even some incomplete result sections. Especially, information on the process of prior elicitation, specification, and evaluation was often lacking. Conclusion Though available guidance papers concerned with reporting of Bayesian analyses emphasize the importance of transparent prior specification, the results obtained in this systematic review show that these guidance papers are often not used. Additional efforts should be made to increase the awareness of the existence and importance of these checklists to overcome the controversy with respect to the use of Bayesian techniques. The reporting quality in epidemiological literature could be improved by updating existing guidelines on the reporting of frequentist analyses to address issues that are important for Bayesian data analyses.},

  abstract = {Each year, thousands of clinical prediction models are developed to make predictions (e.g. estimated risk) to inform individual diagnosis and prognosis in healthcare. However, most are not reliable for use in clinical practice. We discuss how the creation of a prediction model (e.g. using regression or machine learning methods) is dependent on the sample and size of data used to develop it---were a different sample of the same size used from the same overarching population, the developed model could be very different even when the same model development methods are used. In other words, for each model created, there exists a multiverse of other potential models for that sample size and, crucially, an individual's predicted value (e.g. estimated risk) may vary greatly across this multiverse. The more an individual's prediction varies across the multiverse, the greater the instability. We show how small development datasets lead to more different models in the multiverse, often with vastly unstable individual predictions, and explain how this can be exposed by using bootstrapping and presenting instability plots. We recommend healthcare researchers seek to use large model development datasets to reduce instability concerns. This is especially important to ensure reliability across subgroups and improve model fairness in practice. Instability is concerning as an individual's predicted value is used to guide their counselling, resource prioritisation, and clinical decision making. If different samples lead to different models with very different predictions for the same individual, then this should cast doubt into using a particular model for that individual. Therefore, visualising, quantifying and reporting the instability in individual-level predictions is essential when proposing a new model.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Hospitals can leverage their position between the ultimate buyers and sellers of drugs to retain a substantial share of insurer pharmaceutical expenditures. METHODS In this study, we used 2020--2021 national Blue Cross Blue Shield claims data regarding patients in the United States who had drug-infusion visits for oncologic conditions, inflammatory conditions, or blood-cell deficiency disorders. Markups of the reimbursement prices were measured in terms of amounts paid by Blue Cross Blue Shield plans to hospitals and physician practices relative to the amounts paid by these providers to drug manufacturers. Acquisition-price reductions in hospital payments to drug manufacturers were measured in terms of discounts under the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program. We estimated the percentage of Blue Cross Blue Shield drug spending that was received by drug manufacturers and the percentage retained by provider organizations. RESULTS The study included 404,443 patients in the United States who had 4,727,189 druginfusion visits. The median price markup (defined as the ratio of the reimbursement price to the acquisition price) for hospitals eligible for 340B discounts was 3.08 (interquartile range, 1.87 to 6.38). After adjustment for drug, patient, and geographic factors, price markups at hospitals eligible for 340B discounts were 6.59 times (95\% confidence interval [CI], 6.02 to 7.16) as high as those in independent physician practices, and price markups at noneligible hospitals were 4.34 times (95\% CI, 3.77 to 4.90) as high as those in physician practices. Hospitals eligible for 340B discounts retained 64.3\% of insurer drug expenditures, whereas hospitals not eligible for 340B discounts retained 44.8\% and independent physician practices retained 19.1\%. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that hospitals imposed large price markups and retained a substantial share of total insurer spending on physician-administered drugs for patients with private insurance. The effects were especially large for hospitals eligible for discounts under the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program on acquisition costs paid to manufacturers.

Methods: A postal survey among a representative sample of Norwegian physicians across all specialities (N = 1605), using a translated questionnaire previously used to study attitudes towards disclosing prognostic information among US internists. Results: A response rate of 70\% was obtained after one reminder. 85\% of the responders agreed to the helpfulness of an optimistic attitude. A factor analysis revealed three meaningful factors: `Prognostic communication is stressful', `Fearing loss of reputation' and `Reinforcement of positive prospects'. In multivariable models significantly more female than male physicians found aspects of prognostication straining (b = 0.143, p {$<$} 0.001). Those more experienced in communication of prognostic information towards end of life were less likely to support using reinforcement of positive prospects (b = 0.067, p = 0.001). Conclusion: After years of focusing on patient autonomy and open communication between patient and physician many Norwegian physicians display attitudes that might hide the true content of prognostic information from the patients.},

Follow-up was completed in February 2020.Adult patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury were randomly assigned to receive continuous infusion of 20\% hypertonic saline solution plus standard care (n\,=\,185) or standard care alone (controls; n\,=\,185). The 20\% hypertonic saline solution was administered for 48 hours or longer if patients remained at risk of intracranial hypertension.The primary outcome was Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) score (range, 1-8, with lower scores indicating worse functional outcome) at 6 months, obtained centrally by blinded assessors and analyzed with ordinal logistic regression adjusted for prespecified prognostic factors (with a common odds ratio [OR] \&gt;1.0 favoring intervention). There were 12 secondary outcomes measured at multiple time points, including development of intracranial hypertension and 6-month mortality.Among 370 patients who were randomized (median age, 44 [interquartile range, 27-59] years; 77 [20.2\%] women), 359 (97\%) completed the trial. The adjusted common OR for the GOS-E score at 6 months was 1.02 (95\% CI, 0.71-1.47; P\,=\,.92). Of the 12 secondary outcomes, 10 were not significantly different. Intracranial hypertension developed in 62 (33.7\%) patients in the intervention group and 66 (36.3\%) patients in the control group (absolute difference, -2.6\% [95\% CI, -12.3\% to 7.2\%]; OR, 0.80 [95\% CI, 0.51-1.26]). There was no significant difference in 6-month mortality (29 [15.9\%] in the intervention group vs 37 [20.8\%] in the control group; absolute difference, -4.9\% [95\% CI, -12.8\% to 3.1\%]; hazard ratio, 0.79 [95\% CI, 0.48-1.28]).Among patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, treatment with continuous infusion of 20\% hypertonic saline compared with standard care did not result in a significantly better neurological status at 6 months. However, confidence intervals for the findings were wide, and the study may have had limited power to detect a clinically important difference.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03143751},

DESIGN:~         Prospective, observational, mixed-methods cohort study.         SETTING:~         Comprehensive stroke and level 1 trauma center in Pacific Northwest United States.         PARTICIPANTS:~         Family members of patients with severe acute brain injury in an ICU for greater than 2 days and Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 12.         MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:~         At enrollment, we asked what level of physical and cognitive recovery the patient would find acceptable. At 6 months, we assessed level of recovery through family surveys and chart review. Families of patients whose outcome was below that considered acceptable were invited for semistructured interviews, examined with content analysis.         RESULTS:~         For 184 patients, most family members set patients' minimally acceptable cognitive recovery at ``able to think and communicate'' or better (82\%) and physical recovery at independence or better (66\%). Among 170 patients with known 6-month outcome, 40\% had died in hospital. Of 102 survivors, 33\% were able to think and communicate, 13\% were independent, and 10\% died after discharge. Among survivors whose family member had set minimally acceptable cognitive function at ``able to think and communicate,'' 64\% survived below that level; for those with minimally acceptable physical function at independence, 80\% survived below that. Qualitative analysis revealed two key themes: families struggled to adapt to a new, yet uncertain, normal and asked for support and guidance with ongoing treatment decisions.         CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:~         Six months after severe acute brain injury, most patients survived to a state their families initially thought would not be acceptable. Survivors and their families need more support and guidance as they adapt to a new normal and struggle with persistent uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Problem: A significant proportion of learning during residency takes place through informal channels. Spontaneous collaboration among medical learners significantly contributes to this informal learning and is increasingly recognized as a component of the hidden curriculum in medical education. Yet historically, a disproportionate emphasis in medical education has been placed on didactic, structured, and faculty-initiated methods, leaving an important force in medical education understudied and underutilized. We hypothesize that there is significant educational potential in studying and deploying targeted tools to facilitate collaboration among medical learners. Intervention: At our institution, neurology residents implemented the ``Daily Fact Pile'' (DFP), a resident-led, email-based collaboration that served as a platform to share clinical pearls in an informal, digital way. Participation was voluntary and participants were encouraged to share facts that were new to them and thought to be clinically relevant. Motivated by the positive collective experience, we conducted a retrospective examination of this phenomenon. In this context, we developed the concept of ``mutual microlearning'' to characterize this efficient, multidirectional exchange of information. Context: Thirty-six residents in a single neurology residency program utilized the DFP at a large university hospital in the USA between 2018 and 2019. After 21 months of spontaneous and voluntary participation, we assessed the feasibility of the DFP, its impact on the education and morale of neurology residents, and compared its mutual microlearning approach to traditional lectures. This was done through a survey of the DFP participants with a response rate of 80.7\%, and analysis of the statistics of participation and interaction with the DFP. Impact: Most participants felt that the DFP was beneficial to their education and thought they often or always learned something new from reading the DFP. The impact of the DFP extended beyond education by improving interest in neurology, morale, and sense of teamwork. The DFP was feasible during neurology residency and participation was high, though participants were more likely to read facts than share them. Lessons learned: Mutual microlearning represents an opportunity to augment residents' education, and well-designed mutual microlearning tools hold promise for complementing traditional teaching methods. We learned that efficiency, ease of use, and a supportive, non-judgmental environment are all essential to the success of such tools. Future research should delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms of mutual microlearning to establish its position within the theoretical frameworks of medical education.},

METHODS: We analyzed data referring to our prospective population-based registry, including patients with a first-ever stroke followed up to 10 years. RESULTS: In a 5-year period, we included 549 patients (247 men and 302 women; mean age+/-SD, 73.6+/-12.5 years) with an intracerebral hemorrhage. The crude annual incidence rate was 36.9 per 100000 (95\% CI, 33.8 to 40.0), 32.9 per 100000 when standardized to the 2006 European population, and 15.9 per 100000 when standardized to the world population. The case-fatality rate was 34.6\% (95\% CI, 30.6 to 38.6) at 7 days; it increased to 50.3\% (95\% CI, 46.1 to 54.5) at 30 days and to 59.0\% (95\% CI, 54.9 to 63.1) at 1 year. Diabetes mellitus and posterior fossa hemorrhage were associated with an increased risk of 7- and 30-day mortality, whereas older age was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality only. At the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 10-year survival rate was 24.1\% (95\% CI, 20.1 to 28.1). CONCLUSIONS: Intracerebral hemorrhage is characterized by a severe prognosis, mostly in the short term. Because of the high proportion of fatal events that occurs early after the stroke, it is mandatory to identify and apply specific therapeutic strategies for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.},

Because ICP is easily measured at the bedside, it is the target of numerous pharmacologic and surgical interventions in efforts to improve brain physiology and limit secondary injury.

The Second Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Haemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2) study, a multinational, multicenter, randomized controlled trial published in 2013, demonstrated better functional outcomes with no harm for patients with acute spontaneous ICH within 6~h of onset who received target-driven, early intensive BP lowering (systolic BP target {$<$}140~mmHg within 1~h, continued for 7~days) and suggested that greater and faster reduction in BP might enhance the treatment effect by limiting hematoma growth. The trial resulted in revisions of guidelines for acute management of ICH, in which intensive BP lowering in patients with acute ICH is recommended as safe and effective treatment for improving functional outcome. BP lowering is also the only intervention that is proven to reduce the risk of recurrent ICH. Current evidences from several randomized trials, including PROGRESS and SPS3, indicate that long-term strict BP control in patients with ICH is safe and could offer additional benefits in major reduction in risk of recurrent ICH. The latest American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines recommended a target BP of {$<$}130/80~mmHg after ICH, but supporting evidence is limited. Randomized controlled trials are needed that focus on strict BP control, initiated early after onset of the disease and continued long-term, to demonstrate effective prevention of recurrent stroke and other major vascular events without additional harms in the ICH population.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose Controversy exists over the prognostic significance of the affected hemisphere in stroke. We aimed to determine the relationship between laterality of acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and poor clinical outcomes. Methods A subsidiary analysis of the INTERACT Pilot and INTERACT2 studies---randomised controlled trials of patients with spontaneous acute ICH with elevated systolic blood pressure (BP), randomly assigned to intensive (target systolic BP {$<$}140 mm Hg) or guideline-based ({$<$}180 mm Hg) BP management. Outcomes were the combined and separate end points of death and major disability (modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores of 3--6, 6 and 3--5, respectively) at 90 days. Results A total of 2708 patients had supratentorial/hemispheric ICH and information on mRS at 90 days. Patients with right hemispheric ICH (1327, 49\%) had a higher risk of death at 90 days compared to those with left hemispheric ICH after adjustment for potential confounding variables (OR, 1.77 (95\% CI 1.33 to 2.37)). There were no differences between patients with right and left hemispheric ICH regarding the combined end point of death or major disability or major disability in the multivariable-adjusted models (1.07 (0.89 to 1.29) and 0.85 (0.72 to 1.01), respectively). Conclusions Right hemispheric lesion was associated with increased risk of death in patients with acute ICH. The laterality of the ICH does not appear to affect the level of disability in survivors.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess nationwide incidence and outcomes of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The Swiss SOS (Swiss Study on Subarachnoid Hemorrhage) was established in 2008 and offers the unique opportunity to provide this data from the point of care on a nationwide level. METHODS: All patients with confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014, within Switzerland were recorded in a prospective registry. Incidence rates were calculated based on time-matched population data. Admission parameters and outcomes at discharge and at 1 year were recorded. RESULTS: We recorded data of 1787 consecutive patients. The incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in Switzerland was 3.7 per 100\,000 persons/y. The number of female patients was 1170 (65.5\%). With a follow-up rate of 91.3\% at 1 year, 1042 patients (58.8\%) led an independent life according to the modified Rankin Scale (0--2). About 1 in 10 patients survived in a dependent state (modified Rankin Scale, 3--5; n=185; 10.4\%). Case fatality was 20.1\% (n=356) at discharge and 22.1\% (n=391) after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: The current incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in Switzerland is lower than expected and an indication of a global trend toward decreasing admissions for ruptured intracranial aneurysms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) are treated with supplemental oxygen, but the benefits and harms of different oxygenation targets are unclear. We hypothesized that using a lower target for partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) would result in lower mortality than using a higher target. METHODS: In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 2928 adult patients who had recently been admitted to the ICU ({$\leq$}12 hours before randomization) and who were receiving at least 10 liters of oxygen per minute in an open system or had a fraction of inspired oxygen of at least 0.50 in a closed system to receive oxygen therapy targeting a Pao2 of either 60 mm Hg (lower-oxygenation group) or 90 mm Hg (higher-oxygenation group) for a maximum of 90 days. The primary outcome was death within 90 days. RESULTS: At 90 days, 618 of 1441 patients (42.9\%) in the lower-oxygenation group and 613 of 1447 patients (42.4\%) in the higher-oxygenation group had died (adjusted risk ratio, 1.02; 95\% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.11; P\,=\,0.64). At 90 days, there was no significant between-group difference in the percentage of days that patients were alive without life support or in the percentage of days they were alive after hospital discharge. The percentages of patients who had new episodes of shock, myocardial ischemia, ischemic stroke, or intestinal ischemia were similar in the two groups (P\,=\,0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Among adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the ICU, a lower oxygenation target did not result in lower mortality than a higher target at 90 days.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial of patients with severe ARDS undergoing VV-ECMO for less than 48 hours at 14 intensive care units (ICUs) in France between March 3, 2021, and December 7, 2021. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to prone positioning (at least 4 sessions of 16 hours) (n = 86) or to supine positioning (n = 84). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was time to successful ECMO weaning within 60 days following randomization. Secondary outcomes included ECMO and mechanical ventilation--free days, ICU and hospital length of stay, skin pressure injury, serious adverse events, and all-cause mortality at 90-day follow-up. RESULTS Among 170 randomized patients (median age, 51 [IQR, 43-59] years; n = 60 women [35\%]), median respiratory system compliance was 15.0 (IQR, 10.7-20.6) mL/cm H2O; 159 patients (94\%) had COVID-19--related ARDS; and 164 (96\%) were in prone position before ECMO initiation. Within 60 days of enrollment, 38 of 86 patients (44\%) had successful ECMO weaning in the prone ECMO group compared with 37 of 84 (44\%) in the supine ECMO group (risk difference, 0.1\% [95\% CI, -14.9\% to 15.2\%]; subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.11 [95\% CI, 0.71-1.75]; P = .64). Within 90 days, no significant difference was observed in ECMO duration (28 vs 32 days; difference, -4.9 [95\% CI, -11.2 to 1.5] days; P = .13), ICU length of stay, or 90-day mortality (51\% vs 48\%; risk difference, 2.4\% [95\% CI, -13.9\% to 18.6\%]; P = .62). No serious adverse events were reported during the prone position procedure. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with severe ARDS supported by VV-ECMO, prone positioning compared with supine positioning did not significantly reduce time to successful weaning of ECMO.},

Objective: The goal of this study was to explore how family members, nurses, and physicians experience the palliative and supportive care needs of patients with SABI receiving care in the neuroscience intensive care unit (neuro-ICU). Design: Semistructured interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Setting/Subjects: Thirty-bed neuro-ICU in a regional comprehensive stroke and level-one trauma center in the United States. We completed 47 interviews regarding 15 patients with family members (n\,=\,16), nurses (n\,=\,15), and physicians (n\,=\,16). Results: Two themes were identified: (1) hope and (2) personhood. (1) Families linked prognostic uncertainty to a need for hope and expressed a desire for physicians to acknowledge this relationship. The language of hope varied depending on the participant: clinicians used hope as an object that can be given or taken away, generally in the process of conveying prognosis, while families expressed hope as an action that supported coping with their loved one's acute illness and its prognostic uncertainty. (2) Participants described the loss of personhood through brain injury, the need to recognize and treat the brain-injured patient as a person, and the importance of relatedness and connection, including personal support of families by clinicians. Conclusions: Support for hope and preservation of personhood challenge care in the neuro-ICU as identified by families and clinicians of patients with SABI. Specific practical approaches can address these challenges and improve the palliative care provided to patients and families in the neuro-ICU.},

  abstract = {Intravenous fluid therapy is the most common intervention received by acutely ill patients. Historically, saline (0.9\% sodium chloride) has been the most frequently administered intravenous fluid, especially in North America. Balanced crystalloid solutions (e.g., lactated Ringer's, Plasma-Lyte) are an increasingly used alternative to saline. Balanced crystalloids have a sodium, potassium, and chloride content closer to that of extracellular fluid and, when given intravenously, have fewer adverse effects on acid--base balance. Preclinical research has demonstrated that saline may cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, inflammation, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and death. Studies of patients and healthy human volunteers suggest that even relatively small volumes of saline may exert physiological effects. Randomized trials in the operating room have demonstrated that using balanced crystalloids rather than saline prevents the development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may reduce the need for vasopressors. Observational studies among critically ill adults have associated receipt of balanced crystalloids with lower rates of complications, including acute kidney injury and death. Most recently, large randomized trials among critically ill adults have examined whether balanced crystalloids result in less death or severe renal dysfunction than saline. Although some of these trials are still ongoing, a growing body of evidence raises fundamental concerns regarding saline as the primary intravenous crystalloid for critically ill adults and highlights fundamental unanswered questions for future research about fluid therapy in critical illness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Both balanced crystalloids and saline are used for intravenous fluid administration in critically ill adults, but it is not known which results in better clinical outcomes. METHODS In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial conducted in five intensive care units at an academic center, we assigned 15,802 adults to receive saline (0.9\% sodium chloride) or balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) according to the randomization of the unit to which they were admitted. The primary outcome was a major adverse kidney event within 30 days --- a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to {$\geq$}200\% of baseline) --- all censored at hospital discharge or 30 days, whichever occurred first. RESULTS Among the 7942 patients in the balanced-crystalloids group, 1139 (14.3\%) had a major adverse kidney event, as compared with 1211 of 7860 patients (15.4\%) in the saline group (marginal odds ratio, 0.91; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 0.99; conditional odds ratio, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.82 to 0.99; P\,=\,0.04). In-hospital mortality at 30 days was 10.3\% in the balanced-crystalloids group and 11.1\% in the saline group (P\,=\,0.06). The incidence of new renal-replacement therapy was 2.5\% and 2.9\%, respectively (P\,=\,0.08), and the incidence of persistent renal dysfunction was 6.4\% and 6.6\%, respectively (P\,=\,0.60).

  abstract = {Acute kidney injury is common among critically ill adults and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The Major Adverse Kidney Events by 30~days (MAKE30) composite of death, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction is recommended as a patient-centered outcome for pragmatic trials involving acute kidney injury. Accurate electronic detection of the MAKE30 endpoint using data within the electronic health record (EHR) could facilitate the use of the EHR in large-scale kidney injury research. In an observational study using prospectively collected data from 200 admissions to a single medical intensive care unit, we tested the performance of electronically-extracted data in identifying the MAKE30 composite compared to the reference standard of two-physician manual chart review. The incidence of MAKE30 on manual-review was 16~\%, which included 8.5~\% for in-hospital mortality, 3.5~\% for new renal replacement therapy, and 8.5~\% for persistent renal dysfunction. There was strong agreement between the electronic and manual assessment of MAKE30 (98.5~\% agreement [95~\% CI 96.5-100.0~\%]; kappa 0.95 [95~\% CI 0.87-1.00]; P\,{$<$}\,0.001), with only three patients misclassified by electronic assessment. Performance of the electronic MAKE30 assessment was similar among patients with and without CKD and with and without a measured serum creatinine in the 12~months prior to hospital admission. In summary, accurately identifying the MAKE30 composite outcome using EHR data collected as a part of routine care appears feasible.},

This before-and-after study evaluated the outcomes associated with an implementation intervention promoting use of lactated Ringer solution rather than saline solution among nearly 150\,000 patients across 22 hospitals. The intervention used education and changes to the electronic order entry system to affect which fluid patients received beginning immediately at hospital presentation. The proportion of intravenous fluid administered that was lactated Ringer increased (from approximately 25\% to 75\%) and the use of saline decreased (from approximately 75\% to 25\%). In interrupted time series analysis, implementation of lactated Ringer was associated with a 2\% absolute risk reduction in death, new receipt of kidney replacement therapy, or persistent kidney dysfunction. This effect size was greater for patients with sepsis and patients who received more fluid. This study raises important questions about the choice between lactated Ringer and saline and, more broadly, how we should make evidence-based choices between widely available, commonly used treatment alternatives in acute care.},

Although the issues have been generally well-covered in the statistical literature, they seem to be poorly understood in the medical literature and even the statistical literature occasionally shows some confusion. To increase understanding and communication, some simple graphical approaches to illustrating issues are proposed. It is also suggested that reducing variation in medical practice might make as big a contribution to improving health outcome as personalising its delivery according to the patient. It is concluded that the common belief that there is a strong personal element in response to treatment is not based on sound statistical evidence. {\copyright} 2015 The Authors.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe 1-year recovery trajectories among ICH and IVH survivors with initial severe disability and assess the association of hospital events with long-term recovery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This post hoc analysis pooled all individual patient data from the Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage phase 3 trial (CLEAR-III) and the Minimally Invasive Surgery Plus Alteplase for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Evacuation (MISTIE-III) phase 3 trial in multiple centers across the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Patients were enrolled from August 1, 2010, to September 30, 2018, with a follow-up duration of 1 year. Of 999 enrolled patients, 724 survived with a day 30 modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) of 4 to 5 after excluding 13 participants with missing day 30 mRS. An additional 9 patients were excluded because of missing 1-year mRS. The final pooled cohort included 715 patients (71.6\%) with day 30 mRS 4 to 5. Data were analyzed from July 2019 to January 2022. EXPOSURES CLEAR-III participants randomized to intraventricular alteplase vs placebo. MISTIE-III participants randomized to stereotactic thrombolysis of hematoma vs standard medical care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was 1-year mRS. Patients were dichotomized into good outcome at 1 year (mRS 0 to 3) vs poor outcome at 1 year (mRS 4 to 6). Multivariable logistic regression models assessed associations between prospectively adjudicated hospital events and 1-year good outcome after adjusting for demographic characteristics, ICH and IVH severity, and trial cohort. RESULTS Of 715 survivors, 417 (58\%) were male, and the overall mean (SD) age was 60.3 (11.7) years. Overall, 174 participants (24.3\%) were Black, 491 (68.6\%) were White, and 49 (6.9\%) were of other races (including Asian, Native American, and Pacific Islander, consolidated owing to small numbers); 98 (13.7\%) were of Hispanic ethnicity. By 1 year, 129 participants (18\%) had died and 308 (43\%) had achieved mRS 0 to 3. In adjusted models for the combined cohort, diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.50; 95\% CI, 0.26-0.96), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (aOR, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.90-0.96), severe leukoaraiosis (aOR, 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.16-0.54), pineal gland shift (aOR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.76-0.99]), acute ischemic stroke (aOR, 0.44; 95\% CI, 0.21-0.94), gastrostomy (aOR, 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.17-0.50), and persistent hydrocephalus by day 30 (aOR, 0.37; 95\% CI, 0.14-0.98) were associated with lack of recovery. Resolution of ICH (aOR, 1.82; 95\% CI, 1.08-3.04) and IVH (aOR, 2.19; 95\% CI, 1.02-4.68) by day 30 were associated with recovery to good outcome. In the CLEAR-III model, cerebral perfusion pressure less than 60 mm Hg (aOR, 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.13-0.71), sepsis (aOR, 0.05; 95\% CI, 0.00-0.80), and prolonged mechanical ventilation (aOR, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.92-1.00 per day), and in MISTIE-III, need for intracranial pressure monitoring (aOR, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.12-0.98), were additional factors associated with poor outcome. Thirty-day event-based models strongly predicted 1-year outcome (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.83--0.90), with significantly improved discrimination over models using baseline severity factors alone (AUC, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.71-0.80; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among survivors of severe ICH and IVH with initial poor functional outcome, more than 40\% recovered to good outcome by 1 year. Hospital events were strongly associated with long-term functional recovery and may be potential targets for intervention. Avoiding early pessimistic prognostication and delaying prognostication until after treatment may improve ability to predict future recovery.},

The goal is to use data collected in clinical settings such as a patient's hospital record, or data collected in clinical trials, to learn an individualized treatment rule that will have greater benefit than existing treatment policies if applied to the entire population. Concretely, we use this running example: choosing the best blood pressure-lowering medication ``A'' or ``B'' for a patient with hypertension, measured in terms of lower 6-week prospective blood pressure. We note that hypertension is a condition with substantial variation in how patients are actually treated (Hripsak and others, 2016). Learning such individualized treatment rules involves at least two distinct challenges---a statistical one and a causal one.},

This study examines patient preferences for different outcomes of stroke, including death. We presented patients with written case scenarios of stroke outcomes. The scenarios represented four categories of stroke severity (mild, moderate, severe, and fatal), and for nonfatal strokes the scenarios described motor, language, and cognitive deficits. Patients reported values for each of the 10 stroke scenarios using a rank-and-scale method over a 100-point range, with 100 representing perfect health and 0 corresponding to the worst possible health state. One hundred seventeen of 209 consecutive patients at risk for stroke participated in this study. Severe strokes were uniformly rated as having low preference weights (mean +/- SD [median]: 3 +/- 4 [1] for disabling hemiplegia, 8 +/- 9 [5] for confusion, and 15 +/- 14 [10] for global aphasia), and severe motor impairment (a disabling hemiplegia) was rated as significantly worse than death. Even mild deficits resulted in substantial loss to patients (54 +/- 21 [55] for dysarthria and 53 +/- 21 [50] for mild anomia). Strokes may result in a wide variety of post-stroke consequences for patients. Severe strokes may be viewed by patients as tantamount to or worse than death. Even mild strokes may cause significant declines in patient preferences for health states. These data are useful in interpreting studies that report stroke and death, in designing new studies that measure stroke in at-risk populations, and in helping patients reach treatment decisions about therapies designed to prevent strokes.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Out-of-hospital hypotension has been associated with increased mortality in traumatic brain injury. The association of traumatic brain injury mortality with the depth or duration of out-of-hospital hypotension is unknown. We evaluated the relationship between the depth and duration of out-of-hospital hypotension and mortality in major traumatic brain injury. METHODS: We evaluated adults and older children with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury in the preimplementation cohort of Arizona's statewide Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care study. We used logistic regression to determine the association between the depth-duration dose of hypotension (depth of systolic blood pressure {$<$}90 mm Hg integrated over duration [minutes] of hypotension) and odds of inhospital death, controlling for significant confounders. RESULTS: There were 7,521 traumatic brain injury cases included (70.6\% male patients; median age 40 years [interquartile range 24 to 58]). Mortality was 7.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 7.2\% to 8.5\%) among the 6,982 patients without hypotension (systolic blood pressure {$\geq$}90 mm Hg) and 33.4\% (95\% CI 29.4\% to 37.6\%) among the 539 hypotensive patients (systolic blood pressure {$<$}90 mm Hg). Mortality was higher with increased hypotension dose: 0.01 to 14.99 mm Hg-minutes 16.3\%; 15 to 49.99 mm Hg-minutes 28.1\%; 50 to 141.99 mm Hg-minutes 38.8\%; and greater than or equal to 142 mm Hg-minutes 50.4\%. Log2 (the logarithm in base 2) of hypotension dose was associated with traumatic brain injury mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.19 [95\% CI 1.14 to 1.25] per 2-fold increase of dose). CONCLUSION: In this study, the depth and duration of out-of-hospital hypotension were associated with increased traumatic brain injury mortality. Assessments linking out-of-hospital blood pressure with traumatic brain injury outcomes should consider both depth and duration of hypotension.},

However, only a handful of small studies have investigated the influence of the combination of both hypotension and hypoxia occurring together. In patients with major traumatic brain injury, we evaluate the associations between mortality and out-of-hospital hypotension and hypoxia separately and in combination. Methods All moderate or severe traumatic brain injury cases in the preimplementation cohort of the Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care study (a statewide, before/after, controlled study of the effect of implementing the out-of-hospital traumatic brain injury treatment guidelines) from January 1, 2007, to March 31, 2014, were evaluated (exclusions: {$<$}10 years, out-of-hospital oxygen saturation {$\leq$}10\%, and out-of-hospital systolic blood pressure {$<$}40 or {$>$}200 mm Hg). The relationship between mortality and hypotension (systolic blood pressure {$<$}90 mm Hg) or hypoxia (saturation {$<$}90\%) was assessed with multivariable logistic regression, controlling for Injury Severity Score, head region severity, injury type (blunt versus penetrating), age, sex, race, ethnicity, payer, interhospital transfer, and trauma center. Results Among the 13,151 patients who met inclusion criteria (median age 45 years; 68.6\% men), 11,545 (87.8\%) had neither hypotension nor hypoxia, 604 (4.6\%) had hypotension only, 790 (6.0\%) had hypoxia only, and 212 (1.6\%) had both hypotension and hypoxia. Mortality for the 4 study cohorts was 5.6\%, 20.7\%, 28.1\%, and 43.9\%, respectively. The crude and adjusted odds ratios for death within the cohorts, using the patients with neither hypotension nor hypoxia as the reference, were 4.4 and 2.5, 6.6 and 3.0, and 13.2 and 6.1, respectively. Evaluation for an interaction between hypotension and hypoxia revealed that the effects were additive on the log odds of death. Conclusion In this statewide analysis of major traumatic brain injury, combined out-of-hospital hypotension and hypoxia were associated with significantly increased mortality. This effect on survival persisted even after controlling for multiple potential confounders. In fact, the adjusted odds of death for patients with both hypotension and hypoxia were more than 2 times greater than for those with either hypotension or hypoxia alone. These findings seem supportive of the emphasis on aggressive prevention and treatment of hypotension and hypoxia reflected in the current emergency medical services traumatic brain injury treatment guidelines but clearly reveal the need for further study to determine their influence on outcome.},

The objective of this study was to obtain insights into clinicians' knowledge, attitudes and perceived prescribing practices concerning IV isotonic fluids and to analyze perceived prescribing in the context of actual prescribing. Methods This study, conducted at a single center (Medical University of South Carolina), included 1) a cross-sectional survey of physicians and advanced practice providers (APPs) (7/2019-8/2019) and 2) review electronic health record (EHR) claims data (2/2018-1/2019) to quantify the prescribing patterns of isotonic fluids. Results Clinicians perceived ordering equivalent amounts of normal saline and balanced fluids although normal saline ordering predominated (59.7\%). There was significant variation in perceived and actual ordering across specialties, with internal medicine/subspecialty and emergency medicine clinicians reporting preferential use of normal saline and surgical/subspecialty and anesthesia clinicians reporting preferential use of balanced fluids (p {$<$} 0.0001). Clinicians who self-reported providing care in an intensive care unit (ICU) reported more frequent use of balanced fluids than non-ICU clinicians (p~=~0.03). Actual prescribing data mirrored these differences. Clinicians' self-reported use of continuous infusions (p~=~0.0006) and beliefs regarding the volume of fluid required to cause harm (p~=~0.003) were also associated with self-reported differences in fluid prescribing. Clinician experience, most clinical considerations (e.g., indications, contraindications, barriers to using a specific fluid), and fluid cost were not associated with differential prescribing. Conclusions Persistent normal saline utilization is associated with certain specialties, care locations, and the rate and volume of fluid administered, but not with other clinical considerations or cost. These findings can guide interventions to improve evidence-based fluid prescribing.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: A clear understanding of what patients, families, and health care practitioners view as important at the end of life is integral to the success of improving care of dying patients. Empirical evidence defining such factors, however, is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors considered important at the end of life by patients, their families, physicians, and other care providers. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional, stratified random national survey conducted in March-August 1999. PARTICIPANTS: Seriously ill patients (n = 340), recently bereaved family (n = 332), physicians (n = 361), and other care providers (nurses, social workers, chaplains, and hospice volunteers; n = 429). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Importance of 44 attributes of quality at the end of life (5-point scale) and rankings of 9 major attributes, compared in the 4 groups. RESULTS: Twenty-six items consistently were rated as being important ({$>$}70\% responding that item is important) across all 4 groups, including pain and symptom management, preparation for death, achieving a sense of completion, decisions about treatment preferences, and being treated as a "whole person." Eight items received strong importance ratings from patients but less from physicians (P{$<$}.001), including being mentally aware, having funeral arrangements planned, not being a burden, helping others, and coming to peace with God. Ten items had broad variation within as well as among the 4 groups, including decisions about life-sustaining treatments, dying at home, and talking about the meaning of death. Participants ranked freedom from pain most important and dying at home least important among 9 major attributes. CONCLUSIONS: Although pain and symptom management, communication with one's physician, preparation for death, and the opportunity to achieve a sense of completion are important to most, other factors important to quality at the end of life differ by role and by individual. Efforts to evaluate and improve patients' and families' experiences at the end of life must account for diverse perceptions of quality. JAMA. 2000;284:2476-2482.},

  abstract = {Cerebral edema formation stems from disruption of blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity and occurs after injury to the CNS. Due to the restrictive skull, relatively small increases in brain volume can translate into impaired tissue perfusion and brain herniation. In excess, cerebral edema can be gravely harmful. Astrocytes are key participants in cerebral edema by virtue of their relationship with the cerebral vasculature, their unique compliment of solute and water transport proteins, and their general role in brain volume homeostasis. Following the discovery of aquaporins, passive conduits of water flow, aquaporin 4 (AQP4) was identified as the predominant astrocyte water channel. Normally, AQP4 is highly enriched at perivascular endfeet, the outermost layer of the BBB, whereas after injury, AQP4 expression disseminates to the entire astrocytic plasmalemma, a phenomenon termed dysregulation. Arguably, the most important role of AQP4 is to rapidly neutralize osmotic gradients generated by ionic transporters. In pathological conditions, AQP4 is believed to be intimately involved in the formation and clearance of cerebral edema. In this review, we discuss aquaporin function and localization in the BBB during health and injury, and we examine post-injury ionic events that modulate AQP4-dependent edema formation.},

  abstract = {Brain metastases are a very common manifestation of cancer that have historically been approached as a single disease entity given the uniform association with poor clinical outcomes. Fortunately, our understanding of the biology and molecular underpinnings of brain metastases has greatly improved, resulting in more sophisticated prognostic models and multiple patient-related and disease-specific treatment paradigms. In addition, the therapeutic armamentarium has expanded from whole-brain radiotherapy and surgery to include stereotactic radiosurgery, targeted therapies and immunotherapies, which are often used sequentially or in combination. Advances in neuroimaging have provided additional opportunities to accurately screen for intracranial disease at initial cancer diagnosis, target intracranial lesions with precision during treatment and help differentiate the effects of treatment from disease progression by incorporating functional imaging. Given the numerous available treatment options for patients with brain metastases, a multidisciplinary approach is strongly recommended to personalize the treatment of each patient in an effort to improve the therapeutic ratio. Given the ongoing controversies regarding the optimal sequencing of the available and expanding treatment options for patients with brain metastases, enrolment in clinical trials is essential to advance our understanding of this complex and common disease. In this Review, we describe the key features of diagnosis, risk stratification and modern paradigms in the treatment and management of patients with brain metastases and provide speculation on future research directions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare outcomes of EVT vs medical management across different strata of the Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) and infarct core volume in patients with large infarct. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prespecified secondary analysis of subgroups of the Endovascular Therapy in Acute Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusive Patients With a Large Infarct Core (ANGEL-ASPECT) RCT included patients from 46 stroke centers across China between October 2, 2020, and May 18, 2022. Participants were enrolled within 24 hours of symptom onset and had ASPECTS of 3 to 5 or 0 to 2 and infarct core volume of 70 to 100 mL. Patients were divided into 3 groups: ASPECTS of 3 to 5 with infarct core volume less than 70 mL, ASPECTS of 3 to 5 with infarct core volume of 70 mL or greater, and ASPECTS of 0 to 2. INTERVENTIONS Endovascular therapy or medical management. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the ordinal 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. RESULTS There were 455 patients in the trial; median age was 68 years (IQR, 60-73 years), and 279 (61.3\%) were male. The treatment effect did not vary significantly across the 3 baseline imaging subgroups (P = .95 for interaction). The generalized odds ratio for the shift in the 90-day mRS distribution toward better outcomes with EVT vs medical management was 1.40 (95\% CI, 1.06-1.85; P = .01) in patients with ASPECTS of 3 to 5 and infarct core volume less than 70 mL, 1.22 (95\% CI, 0.81-1.83; P = .23) in patients with ASPECTS of 3 to 5 and infarct core volume of 70 mL or greater, and 1.59 (95\% CI, 0.89-2.86; P = .09) in patients with ASPECTS of 0 to 2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, no significant interaction was found between baseline imaging status and the benefit of EVT compared with medical management in patients with large infarct core volume. However, estimates within subgroups were underpowered. A pooled analysis of large core trials stratified by ASPECTS and infarct core volume strata is warranted.},

However, specific data for ICH are lacking. Here, we aimed to investigate the association between ICP, mortality and functional outcome following severe ICH. Methods We analyzed consecutive comatose patients with ICH in whom ICP monitoring was applied. Outcome at 3months was assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS). Multivariate logistic regression including pre-defined predictors was used in order to identify the effects of ICP on outcome. Results 121 patients with ICH and ICP monitoring were analyzed. Mean ICP (OR 1.2, CI 1.08--1.45, p=0.003), ICP variability (OR 1.3, CI 1.03--1.73, p=0.03) and relative frequency of ICP values {$>$}20mmHg (OR 1.1, CI 1.02-- 1.15, p=0.008) were independently associated with mortality at 3months. Relative frequency of ICP values {$>$}20mmHg (OR 1.1, CI 1.001--1.3, p=0.04) was associated also with poor functional outcome at 3months. Conclusions Our data suggest that in the context of other predictors as age, admission clinical status, hemorrhage volume and intraventricular hemorrhage, average ICP, ICP variability and the frequency of ICP values {$>$}20mmHg are independently associated with mortality and poor outcome after ICH. Further studies and prospective validations of ICP thresholds for ICH patients are highly warranted.},

Methods We included patients with an LVO stroke of the anterior circulation who were transferred to our hospital for EVT and underwent repeated imaging between January 2016 and June 2019. We compared patient characteristics, workflow time metrics, functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale at 90 days), and baseline thrombus imaging characteristics, which included: occlusion location, thrombus length, attenuation, perviousness, distance from terminus of intracranial carotid artery to the thrombus (DT), and clot burden score (CBS), between early-recanalized LVO (ER-LVO), and non-early-recanalized LVO (NER-LVO) patients. Results One hundred and forty-nine patients were included in the analysis. Early recanalization occurred in 32\% of patients. ER-LVO patients less often had a medical history of hypertension (31\% vs 49\%, P=0.04), and more often had clinical improvement between PSC and CSC ({$\Delta$}NIHSS -5 vs 3, P{$<$}0.01), compared with NER-LVO patients. Thrombolysis administration was similar in both groups (88\% vs 78\%, P=0.18). ER-LVO patients had no ICA occlusions (0\% vs 27\%, P{$<$}0.01), more often an M2 occlusion (35\% vs 17\%, P=0.01), longer DT (27 mm vs 12 mm, P{$<$}0.01), shorter thrombi (17 mm vs 27 mm, P{$<$}0.01), and higher CBS (8 vs 6, P{$<$}0.01) at baseline imaging. ER-LVO patients had lower mRS scores (1 vs 3, P=0.02). Conclusions Early recanalization is associated with clinical improvement between PSC and CSC admission, more distal occlusions and shorter thrombi at baseline imaging, and better functional outcome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients who are undergoing mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) often receive a high fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) and have a high arterial oxygen tension. The conservative use of oxygen may reduce oxygen exposure, diminish lung and systemic oxidative injury, and thereby increase the number of ventilator-free days (days alive and free from mechanical ventilation). METHODS We randomly assigned 1000 adult patients who were anticipated to require mechanical ventilation beyond the day after recruitment in the ICU to receive conservative or usual oxygen therapy. In the two groups, the default lower limit for oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) was 90\%. In the conservativeoxygen group, the upper limit of the Spo2 alarm was set to sound when the level reached 97\%, and the Fio2 was decreased to 0.21 if the Spo2 was above the acceptable lower limit. In the usual-oxygen group, there were no specific measures limiting the Fio2 or the Spo2. The primary outcome was the number of ventilatorfree days from randomization until day 28. RESULTS The number of ventilator-free days did not differ significantly between the conservative-oxygen group and the usual-oxygen group, with a median duration of 21.3 days (interquartile range, 0 to 26.3) and 22.1 days (interquartile range, 0 to 26.2), respectively, for an absolute difference of -0.3 days (95\% confidence interval [CI], -2.1 to 1.6; P\,=\,0.80). The conservative-oxygen group spent more time in the ICU with an Fio2 of 0.21 than the usual-oxygen group, with a median duration of 29 hours (interquartile range, 5 to 78) and 1 hour (interquartile range, 0 to 17), respectively (absolute difference, 28 hours; 95\% CI, 22 to 34); the conservative-oxygen group spent less time with an Spo2 exceeding 96\%, with a duration of 27 hours (interquartile range, 11 to 63.5) and 49 hours (interquartile range, 22 to 112), respectively (absolute difference, 22 hours; 95\% CI, 14 to 30). At 180 days, mortality was 35.7\% in the conservative-oxygen group and 34.5\% in the usual-oxygen group, for an unadjusted odds ratio of 1.05 (95\% CI, 0.81 to 1.37).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early hypotension after severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is associated with increased mortality and poor long-term outcomes. Current guidelines suggest the use of intravenous vasopressors, commonly norepinephrine and phenylephrine, to support blood pressure after TBI. However, guidelines do not specify vasopressor type, resulting in variation in clinical practice. We describe early vasopressor utilization patterns in critically ill patients with TBI and examine the association between utilization of norepinephrine, compared to phenylephrine, with hospital mortality after sTBI. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of US hospitals participating in the Premier Healthcare Database between 2009 and 2018. We examined adult patients ({$>$}17 years of age) with a primary diagnosis of sTBI who were treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) after injury. The primary exposure was vasopressor choice (phenylephrine versus norepinephrine) within the first 2 days of hospital admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes examined included hospital length of stay (LOS) and ICU LOS. We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis in all patients with intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor placement. Regression analysis was used to assess differences in outcomes between patients exposed to phenylephrine versus norepinephrine, with propensity matching to address selection bias due to the nonrandom allocation of treatment groups. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2018, 24,718 (37.1\%) of 66,610 sTBI patients received vasopressors within the first 2 days of hospitalization. Among these patients, 60.6\% (n = 14,991) received only phenylephrine, 10.8\% (n = 2668) received only norepinephrine, 3.5\% (n = 877) received other vasopressors, and 25.0\% (n = 6182) received multiple vasopressors. In that time period, the use of all vasopressors after sTBI increased. A moderate degree of variation in vasopressor choice was explained at the individual hospital level (23.1\%). In propensity-matched analysis, the use of norepinephrine compared to phenylephrine was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.65; CI, 1.46--1.86; P {$<$} .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Early vasopressor utilization among critically ill patients with sTBI is common, increasing over the last decade, and varies across hospitals caring for TBI patients. Compared to phenylephrine, norepinephrine was associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality in propensity-matched analysis. Given the wide variation in vasopressor utilization and possible differences in efficacy, our analysis suggests the need for randomized controlled trials to better inform vasopressor choice for patients with sTBI.{\enspace} (Anesth Analg 2022;00:00--00)},

Although such care can be hard to define, in some circumstances experienced clinicians can be virtually certain that attempts at resuscitation will fail. In these cases, many argue that hospitals should adopt policies that allow physicians to refuse when families demand futile cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

The Statistical Update presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs). Methods: The American Heart Association, through its Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update. The 2022 Statistical Update is the product of a full year's worth of effort by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff members. This year's edition includes data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population and an enhanced focus on social determinants of health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, vascular contributions to brain health, and the global burden of cardiovascular disease and healthy life expectancy. Results: Each of the chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics. Conclusions: The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policymakers, media professionals, clinicians, health care administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions.},

  abstract = {Background Malignant infarction of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is associated with an 80\% mortality rate. Non-randomised studies have suggested that decompressive surgery reduces this mortality without increasing the number of severely disabled survivors. To obtain sufficient data as soon as possible to reliably estimate the effects of decompressive surgery, results from three European randomised controlled trials (DECIMAL, DESTINY, HAMLET) were pooled. The trials were ongoing when the pooled analysis was planned. Methods Individual data for patients aged between 18 years and 60 years, with space-occupying MCA infarction, included in one of the three trials, and treated within 48 h after stroke onset were pooled for analysis. The protocol was designed prospectively when the trials were still recruiting patients and outcomes were defined without knowledge of the results of the individual trials. The primary outcome measure was the score on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 1 year dichotomised between favourable (0--4) and unfavourable (5 and death) outcome. Secondary outcome measures included case fatality rate at 1 year and a dichotomisation of the mRS between 0--3 and 4 to death. Data analysis was done by an independent data monitoring committee. Findings 93 patients were included in the pooled analysis. More patients in the decompressive-surgery group than in the control group had an mRS{$\leq$}4 (75\% vs 24\%; pooled absolute risk reduction 51\% [95\% CI 34--69]), an mRS{$\leq$}3 (43\% vs 21\%; 23\% [5--41]), and survived (78\% vs 29\%; 50\% [33--67]), indicating numbers needed to treat of two for survival with mRS{$\leq$}4, four for survival with mRS{$\leq$}3, and two for survival irrespective of functional outcome. The effect of surgery was highly consistent across the three trials. Interpretation In patients with malignant MCA infarction, decompressive surgery undertaken within 48 h of stroke onset reduces mortality and increases the number of patients with a favourable functional outcome. The decision to perform decompressive surgery should, however, be made on an individual basis in every patient.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate the relationship between ICU admission and outcomes for elderly patients with pneumonia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries (aged {$>$}64 years) admitted to 2988 acute care hospitals in the United States with pneumonia from 2010 to 2012. EXPOSURES ICU admission vs general ward admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included Medicare spending and hospital costs. Patient and hospital characteristics were adjusted to account for differences between patients with and without ICU admission. To account for unmeasured confounding, an instrumental variable was used---the differential distance to a hospital with high ICU admission (defined as any hospital in the upper 2 quintiles of ICU use). RESULTS Among 1 112 394 Medicare beneficiaries with pneumonia, 328 404 (30\%) were admitted to the ICU. In unadjusted analyses, patients admitted to the ICU had significantly higher 30-day mortality, Medicare spending, and hospital costs than patients admitted to a general hospital ward. Patients (n = 553 597) living closer than the median differential distance ({$<$}3.3 miles) to a hospital with high ICU admission were significantly more likely to be admitted to the ICU than patients living farther away (n = 558 797) (36\% for patients living closer vs 23\% for patients living farther, P {$<$} .001). In adjusted analyses, for the 13\% of patients whose ICU admission decision appeared to be discretionary (dependent only on distance), ICU admission was associated with a significantly lower adjusted 30-day mortality (14.8\% for ICU admission vs 20.5\% for general ward admission, P = .02; absolute decrease, -5.7\% [95\% CI, -10.6\%, -0.9\%]), yet there were no significant differences in Medicare spending or hospital costs for the hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with pneumonia, ICU admission of patients for whom the decision appeared to be discretionary was associated with improved survival and no significant difference in costs. A randomized trial may be warranted to assess whether more liberal ICU admission policies improve mortality for patients with pneumonia.},

Both the amounts of fluid volumes infused and the type and tonicity of maintenance fluids are relevant in understanding the impact of fluids on the pathophysiology of secondary brain injuries in these patients. In this narrative review, current evidence on routine fluid management of critically ill brain-injured patients and use of haemodynamic monitoring is summarized. Pertinent guidelines and consensus statements on fluid management for brain-injured patients are highlighted. In general, existing guidelines indicate that fluid management in these neurocritical care patients should be targeted at euvolemia using isotonic fluids. A critical appraisal is made of the available literature regarding the appropriate amount of fluids, haemodynamic monitoring and which types of fluids should be administered or avoided and a practical approach to fluid management is elaborated. Although hypovolemia is bound to contribute to secondary brain injury, some more recent data have emerged indicating the potential risks of fluid overload. However, it is acknowledged that many factors govern the relationship between fluid management and cerebral blood flow and oxygenation and more research seems warranted to optimise fluid management and improve outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} In patients with severe brain injury, withdrawal of life-sustaining measures (WLSM) is common in intensive care units (ICU). WLSM constitutes a dilemma: instituting WLSM too early could result in death despite the possibility of an acceptable functional outcome, whereas delaying WLSM could unnecessarily burden patients, families, clinicians, and hospital resources. We aimed to describe the occurrence and timing of WLSM, and factors associated with timing of WLSM in European ICUs in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods:{\enspace} The CENTER-TBI Study is a prospective multi-center cohort study. For the current study, patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) admitted to the ICU and aged 16 or older were included. Occurrence and timing of WLSM were documented. For the analyses, we dichotomized timing of WLSM in early ({$<$}\,72 h after injury) versus later ({$\geq$}\,72 h after injury) based on recent guideline recommendations. We assessed factors associated with initiating WLSM early versus later, including geographic region, center, patient, injury, and treatment characteristics with univariable and multivariable (mixed effects) logistic regression. Results:{\enspace} A total of 2022 patients aged 16 or older were admitted to the ICU. ICU mortality was 13\% (n\,=\,267). Of these, 229 (86\%) patients died after WLSM, and were included in the analyses. The occurrence of WLSM varied between regions ranging from 0\% in Eastern Europe to 96\% in Northern Europe. In 51\% of the patients, WLSM was early. Patients in the early WLSM group had a lower maximum therapy intensity level (TIL) score than patients in the later WLSM group (median of 5 versus 10) The strongest independent variables associated with early WLSM were one unreactive pupil (odds ratio (OR) 4.0, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.3--12.4) or two unreactive pupils (OR 5.8, CI 2.6--13.1) compared to two reactive pupils, and an Injury Severity Score (ISS) if over 41 (OR per point above 41\,=\,1.1, CI 1.0--1.1). Timing of WLSM was not significantly associated with region or center. Conclusion:{\enspace} WLSM occurs early in half of the patients, mostly in patients with severe TBI affecting brainstem reflexes who were severely injured. We found no regional or center influences in timing of WLSM. Whether WLSM is always appropriate or may contribute to a self-fulfilling prophecy requires further research and argues for reluctance to institute WLSM early in case of any doubt on prognosis.},

However, most approaches to these issues have considered external validity separately from internal validity. Here we argue that considering either internal or external validity in isolation may be problematic. Further, we argue that a joint measure of the validity of an effect estimate with respect to a specific population of interest may be more useful: We call this proposed measure target validity. In this work, we introduce and formally define target bias as the total difference between the true causal effect in the target population and the estimated causal effect in the study sample, and target validity as target bias = 0. We illustrate this measure with a series of examples and show how this measure may help us to think more clearly about comparisons between experimental and nonexperimental research results. Specifically, we show that even perfect internal validity does not ensure that a causal effect will be unbiased in a specific target population.},

Objectives. The authors sought to 1) develop a framework to describe the language physicians use to disclose prognosis, 2) determine whether physicians frame prognostic statements as estimates for populations or estimates for individual patients, and 3) determine whether physicians use the recommended ``ask-tell-ask'' approach when discussing prognosis. Methods. The authors conducted a multicenter, cross-sectional study of 51 audiotaped physician-family conferences about life support decisions in ICUs. They identified each prognostic statement and used grounded theory methods to develop a framework to understand the language physicians use to communicate prognosis. Main Results. Physicians prognosticated in 50 of 51 conferences. When discussing prognosis, physicians used qualitative probability statements in 72\% (36/50) of conferences, numeric statements in 20\% (10/50), absolute statements in 13\% (4/32), and nonprobabilistic statements in 40\% (20/50). Physicians exclusively used population-based language in 10\% (5/50) of conferences, single-event probability statements in 62\% (31/50), and both in 28\% (14/ 50). In only 2\% (1/50) of conferences did physicians ask whether the family wished to hear prognostic information prior to discussing it, and in only 14\% of conferences (7/50) did physicians check to verify that families understood the prognostic information. Conclusions. There is considerable variability in the language used by physicians to disclose prognosis, with only 20\% of physicians using quantitative terms. Very few physicians checked whether families understood prognostic information. These findings may provide potential targets for interventions to improve communication about prognosis in ICUs.},

We report here the design and methods for this large, prospective, multi-center case--control study of ICH.                                         Methods---               The Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study is a multi-center, prospective case--control study of ICH. Cases are identified by hot-pursuit and enrolled using standard phenotype and risk factor information and include neuroimaging and blood sample collection. Controls are centrally identified by random digit dialing to match cases by age ({\textpm}5 years), race, ethnicity, sex, and metropolitan region.                                         Results---               As of March 22, 2013, 1655 cases of ICH had been recruited into the study, which is 101.5\% of the target for that date, and 851 controls had been recruited, which is 67.2\% of the target for that date (1267 controls) for a total of 2506 subjects, which is 86.5\% of the target for that date (2897 subjects). Of the 1655 cases enrolled, 1640 cases had the case interview entered into the database, of which 628 (38\%) were non-Hispanic black, 458 (28\%) were non-Hispanic white, and 554 (34\%) were Hispanic. Of the 1197 cases with imaging submitted, 876 (73.2\%) had a 24 hour follow-up CT available. In addition to CT imaging, 607 cases have had MRI evaluation.                                         Conclusions---               The ERICH study is a large, case--control study of ICH with particular emphasis on recruitment of minority populations for the identification of genetic and epidemiological risk factors for ICH and outcomes after ICH.},

  abstract = {Objective Tenecteplase improves reperfusion compared to alteplase in patients with large vessel occlusions. To determine whether this improvement varies across the spectrum of thrombolytic agent to reperfusion assessment times, we performed a comparative analysis of tenecteplase and alteplase reperfusion rates. Methods Patients with large vessel occlusion and treatment with thrombolysis were pooled from the Melbourne Stroke Registry, and the EXTEND-IA and EXTEND-IA TNK trials. The primary outcome, thrombolytic-induced reperfusion, was defined as the absence of retrievable thrombus or {$>$}50\% reperfusion at imaging reassessment. We compared the treatment effect of tenecteplase and alteplase, accounting for thrombolytic to assessment exposure times, via Poisson modeling. We compared 90-day outcomes of patients who achieved reperfusion with a thrombolytic to patients who achieved reperfusion via endovascular therapy using ordinal logistic regression. Results Among 893 patients included in the primary analysis, thrombolytic-induced reperfusion was observed in 184 (21\%) patients. Tenecteplase was associated with higher rates of reperfusion (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 1.50, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09--2.07, p = 0.01). Findings were consistent in patient subgroups with first segment (aIRR = 1.41, 95\% CI = 0.93--2.14) and second segment (aIRR = 2.07, 95\% CI = 0.98--4.37) middle cerebral artery occlusions. Increased thrombolytic to reperfusion assessment times were associated with reperfusion (tenecteplase: adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.08 per 15 minutes, 95\% CI = 1.04--1.13 vs alteplase: aRR = 1.06 per 15 minutes, 95\% CI = 1.00--1.13). No significant treatment-by-time interaction was observed (p = 0.87). Reperfusion via thrombolysis was associated with improved 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores (adjusted common odds ratio = 2.15, 95\% CI = 1.54--3.01) compared to patients who achieved reperfusion following endovascular therapy. Interpretation Tenecteplase, compared to alteplase, increases prethrombectomy reperfusion, regardless of the time from administration to reperfusion assessment. Prethrombectomy reperfusion is associated with better clinical outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2023;93:489--499},

  abstract = {Background: Intracranial occlusion site, contrast permeability, and clot burden are thrombus characteristics that influence alteplase-associated reperfusion. In this study, we assessed the reperfusion efficacy of tenecteplase and alteplase in subgroups based on these characteristics in a pooled analysis of the EXTEND-IA TNK trial (Tenecteplase Versus Alteplase Before Endovascular Therapy for Ischemic Stroke). Methods: Patients with large vessel occlusion were randomized to treatment with tenecteplase (0.25 or 0.4 mg/kg) or alteplase before thrombectomy in hospitals across Australia and New Zealand (2015--2019). The primary outcome, early reperfusion, was defined as the absence of retrievable thrombus or {$>$}50\% reperfusion on first-pass angiogram. We compared the effect of tenecteplase versus alteplase overall, and in subgroups, based on the following measured with computed tomography angiography: intracranial occlusion site, contrast permeability (measured via residual flow grades), and clot burden (measured via clot burden scores). We adjusted for covariates using mixed effects logistic regression models. Results: Tenecteplase was associated with higher odds of early reperfusion (75/369 [20\%] versus alteplase: 9/96 [9\%], adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.18 [95\% CI, 1.03--4.63]). The difference between thrombolytics was notable in occlusions with low clot burden (tenecteplase: 66/261 [25\%] versus alteplase: 5/67 [7\%], aOR, 3.93 [95\% CI, 1.50--10.33]) when compared to high clot burden lesions (tenecteplase: 9/108 [8\%] versus alteplase: 4/29 [14\%], aOR, 0.58 [95\% CI, 0.16--2.06]; Pinteraction=0.01). We did not observe an association between contrast permeability and tenecteplase treatment effect (permeability present: aOR, 2.83 [95\% CI, 1.00--8.05] versus absent: aOR, 1.98 [95\% CI, 0.65--6.03]; Pinteraction=0.62). Tenecteplase treatment effect was superior with distal M1 or M2 occlusions (53/176 [30\%] versus alteplase: 4/42 [10\%], aOR, 3.73 [95\% CI, 1.25--11.11]), but both thrombolytics had limited efficacy with internal carotid artery occlusions (tenecteplase 1/73 [1\%] versus alteplase 1/19 [5\%], aOR, 0.22 [95\% CI, 0.01--3.83]; Pinteraction=0.16). Conclusions: Tenecteplase demonstrates superior early reperfusion versus alteplase in lesions with low clot burden. Reperfusion efficacy remains limited in internal carotid artery occlusions and lesions with high clot burden. Further innovation in thrombolytic therapies are required.},

  abstract = {Saline (0.9\% sodium chloride) is the most commonly administered intravenous fluid; however, its use may be associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) and increased mortality.To determine the effect of a buffered crystalloid compared with saline on renal complications in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).Double-blind, cluster randomized, double-crossover trial conducted in 4 ICUs in New Zealand from April 2014 through October 2014. Three ICUs were general medical and surgical ICUs; 1 ICU had a predominance of cardiothoracic and vascular surgical patients.All patients admitted to the ICU requiring crystalloid fluid therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients with established AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) were excluded. All 2278 eligible patients were enrolled; 1152 of 1162 patients (99.1\%)  receiving buffered crystalloid and 1110 of 1116 patients (99.5\%) receiving saline were analyzed.Participating ICUs were assigned a masked study fluid, either saline or a buffered crystalloid, for alternating 7-week treatment blocks. Two ICUs commenced using 1 fluid and the other 2 commenced using the alternative fluid. Two crossovers occurred so that each ICU used each fluid twice over the 28 weeks of the study. The treating clinician determined the rate and frequency of fluid administration.The primary outcome was proportion of patients with AKI (defined as a rise in serum creatinine level of at least 2-fold or a serum creatinine level of  {$\geq$}3.96 mg/dL with an increase of {$\geq$}0.5 mg/dL); main secondary outcomes were incidence of RRT use and in-hospital mortality.In the buffered crystalloid group, 102 of 1067 patients (9.6\%) developed AKI within 90 days after enrollment compared with 94 of 1025 patients (9.2\%) in the saline group (absolute difference, 0.4\% [95\% CI, -2.1\% to 2.9\%]; relative risk [RR], 1.04 [95\% CI, 0.80 to 1.36]; P\,=\,.77). In the buffered crystalloid group, RRT was used in 38 of 1152 patients (3.3\%) compared with 38 of 1110 patients (3.4\%) in the saline group (absolute difference, -0.1\% [95\% CI, -1.6\% to 1.4\%]; RR, 0.96 [95\% CI, 0.62 to 1.50]; P\,=\,.91). Overall, 87 of 1152 patients (7.6\%) in the buffered crystalloid group and 95 of 1110 patients (8.6\%) in the saline group died in the hospital (absolute difference, -1.0\% [95\% CI, -3.3\% to 1.2\%]; RR, 0.88 [95\% CI, 0.67 to 1.17]; P\,=\,.40).Among patients receiving crystalloid fluid therapy in the ICU, use of a buffered crystalloid compared with saline did not reduce the risk of AKI. Further large randomized clinical trials are needed to assess efficacy in higher-risk populations and to measure clinical outcomes such as mortality.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: ACTRN12613001370796},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess physician prognosis and treatment recommendations for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and to determine the effect of providing physicians a validated prognostic score. METHODS: A written survey with 2 ICH scenarios was completed by practicing neurologists and neurosurgeons. Selected factors were randomly varied (patient older vs middle age, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 7T vs 11, and presence vs absence of a validated prognostic score). Outcomes included predicted 30-day mortality and recommendations for initial treatment intensity (6-point scale ranging from 1 = comfort only to 6 = full treatment). RESULTS: A total of 742 physicians were included (mean age 52, 32\% neurosurgeons, 17\% female). Physician predictions of 30-day mortality varied widely (mean [range] for the 4 possible combinations of age and GCS were 23\% [0\%-80\%], 35\% [0\%-100\%], 48\% [0\%-100\%], and 58\% [5\%-100\%]). Treatment recommendations also varied widely, with responses encompassing the full range of response options for each case. No physician demographic or personality characteristics were associated with treatment recommendations. Providing a prognostic score changed treatment recommendations, and the effect differed across cases. When the prognostic score suggested 0\% chance of functional independence (76-year-old with GCS 7T), the likelihood of treatment limitations was increased (odds ratio [OR] 1.61, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.33) compared to no prognostic score. Conversely, if the score suggested a 66\% chance of independence (63-year-old with GCS 11), treatment limitations were less likely (OR 0.62, 95\% CI 0.43-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians vary substantially in ICH prognostic estimates and treatment recommendations. This variability could have a profound effect on life and death decision-making and treatment for ICH.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To assess whether results of a randomized controlled trial could be affected by fluid use before enrollment and admission type. Methods: Secondary post-hoc analysis of the Balanced Solution in Intensive Care (BaSICS) trial, which compared a balanced solution (Plasma-Lyte 148) to 0.9\% saline in intensive care unit. Patients were categorized according to fluid use in the 24 hours before enrollment in four groups: balanced solutions only; 0.9\% saline only; mix of both, and no fluid before enrollment, and according to admission type (planned, unplanned with sepsis and unplanned without sepsis). The association between 90-day mortality and the randomization group was assessed using an hierarchical logistic Bayesian model. Measurements and Main Results: 10,520 patients were included. There was a low probability that the balanced solution was associated with improved 90-day mortality in the whole trial population (odds ratio, 0.95; 89\% credible intervals [CrI], 0.66-1.51; probability of benefit, 0.58); however, probability of benefit was high for patients that received only balanced solutions before enrollment (regardless of admission type, odds ratio, 0.78, 89\% CrI, 0.56,1.03; probability of benefit, 0.92), mostly due to a benefit in unplanned admissions due to sepsis (odd ratio, 0.70; 89\% CrI, 0.50-0.97; probability of benefit, 0.96) and planned admissions (odds ratio, 0.79; 89\% CrI, 0.65-0.97; 0.97 probability of benefit, 0.97). Conclusion: There is a high probability that balanced solution use in the ICU reduces 90-day mortality in patients that exclusively received balanced fluids before trial enrollment.},

  abstract = {Timing of initiation of kidney-replacement therapy (KRT) in critically ill patients remains controversial. The Standard versus Accelerated Initiation of Renal-Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney Injury (STARRT-AKI) trial compared two strategies of KRT initiation (accelerated versus standard) in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and found neutral results for 90-day all-cause mortality. Probabilistic exploration of the trial endpoints may enable greater understanding of the trial findings. We aimed to perform a reanalysis using a Bayesian framework. We performed a secondary analysis of all 2927 patients randomized in multi-national STARRT-AKI trial, performed at 168 centers in 15 countries. The primary endpoint, 90-day all-cause mortality, was evaluated using hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression. A spectrum of priors includes optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic priors, along with priors informed from earlier clinical trials. Secondary endpoints (KRT-free days and hospital-free days) were assessed using zero--one inflated beta regression. The posterior probability of benefit comparing an accelerated versus a standard KRT initiation strategy for the primary endpoint suggested no important difference, regardless of the prior used (absolute difference of 0.13\% [95\% credible interval [CrI] - 3.30\%; 3.40\%], - 0.39\% [95\% CrI - 3.46\%; 3.00\%], and 0.64\% [95\% CrI - 2.53\%; 3.88\%] for neutral, optimistic, and pessimistic priors, respectively). There was a very low probability that the effect size was equal or larger than a consensus-defined minimal clinically important difference. Patients allocated to the accelerated strategy had a lower number of KRT-free days (median absolute difference of - 3.55 days [95\% CrI - 6.38; - 0.48]), with a probability that the accelerated strategy was associated with more KRT-free days of 0.008. Hospital-free days were similar between strategies, with the accelerated strategy having a median absolute difference of 0.48 more hospital-free days (95\% CrI - 1.87; 2.72) compared with the standard strategy and the probability that the accelerated strategy had more hospital-free days was 0.66. In a Bayesian reanalysis of the STARRT-AKI trial, we found very low probability that an accelerated strategy has clinically important benefits compared with the standard strategy. Patients receiving the accelerated strategy probably have fewer days alive and KRT-free. These findings do not support the adoption of an accelerated strategy of KRT initiation.},

  abstract = {Intravenous fluids are used for almost all intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Clinical and laboratory studies have questioned whether specific fluid types result in improved outcomes, including mortality and acute kidney injury.To determine the effect of a balanced solution vs saline solution (0.9\% sodium chloride) on 90-day survival in critically ill patients.Double-blind, factorial, randomized clinical trial conducted at 75 ICUs in Brazil. Patients who were admitted to the ICU with at least 1 risk factor for worse outcomes, who required at least 1 fluid expansion, and who were expected to remain in the ICU for more than 24 hours were randomized between May 29, 2017, and March 2, 2020; follow-up concluded on October 29, 2020. Patients were randomized to 2 different fluid types (a balanced solution vs saline solution reported in this article) and 2 different infusion rates (reported separately).Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either a balanced solution (n\,=\,5522) or 0.9\% saline solution (n\,=\,5530) for all intravenous fluids.The primary outcome was 90-day survival.Among 11\,052 patients who were randomized, 10\,520 (95.2\%) were available for the analysis (mean age, 61.1 [SD, 17] years; 44.2\% were women). There was no significant interaction between the 2 interventions (fluid type and infusion speed; P\,=\,.98). Planned surgical admissions represented 48.4\% of all patients. Of all the patients, 60.6\% had hypotension or vasopressor use and 44.3\% required mechanical ventilation at enrollment. Patients in both groups received a median of 1.5 L of fluid during the first day after enrollment. By day 90, 1381 of 5230 patients (26.4\%) assigned to a balanced solution died vs 1439 of 5290 patients (27.2\%) assigned to saline solution (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97 [95\% CI, 0.90-1.05]; P\,=\,.47). There were no unexpected treatment-related severe adverse events in either group.Among critically ill patients requiring fluid challenges, use of a balanced solution compared with 0.9\% saline solution did not significantly reduce 90-day mortality. The findings do not support the use of this balanced solution.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02875873},

  abstract = {Most randomized trials are designed and analyzed using frequentist statistical approaches such as null hypothesis testing and P values. Conceptually, P values are cumbersome to understand, as they provide evidence of data incompatibility with a null hypothesis (e.g., no clinical benefit) and not direct evidence of the alternative hypothesis (e.g., clinical benefit). This counterintuitive framework may contribute to the misinterpretation that the absence of evidence is equal to evidence of absence and may cause the discounting of potentially informative data. Bayesian methods provide an alternative, probabilistic interpretation of data. The reanalysis of completed trials using Bayesian methods is becoming increasingly common, particularly for trials with effect estimates that appear clinically significant despite P values above the traditional threshold of 0.05. Statistical inference using Bayesian methods produces a distribution of effect sizes that would be compatible with observed trial data, interpreted in the context of prior assumptions about an intervention (called "priors"). These priors are chosen by investigators to reflect existing beliefs and past empirical evidence regarding the effect of an intervention. By calculating the likelihood of clinical benefit, a Bayesian reanalysis can augment the interpretation of a trial. However, if priors are not defined a priori, there is a legitimate concern that priors could be constructed in a manner that produces biased results. Therefore, some standardization of priors for Bayesian reanalysis of clinical trials may be desirable for the critical care community. In this Critical Care Perspective, we discuss both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to clinical trial analysis, introduce a framework that researchers can use to select priors for a Bayesian reanalysis, and demonstrate how to apply our proposal by conducting a novel Bayesian trial reanalysis.},
