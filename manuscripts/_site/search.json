    "section": "Methods",
    "text": "Methods\n\nStudy Design and Participants\nWe conducted a post-hoc analysis using data from 2 prospective studies: the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH-2) trial10 and the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH)11 study. ATACH-2 was a large, multicenter, international, open-label, blinded-endpoint randomized controlled trial enrolling 1000 patients with ICH and randomizing them to either intesive blood pressure control (110-139 mm Hg) or standard blood pressure control (140-179 mm Hg). ERICH was a large, multicenter, prospective observational study enrolling patients in the United States admitted with ICH. Study protocols and results of both studies have been previously published.\nWe included all patients enrolled in these two studies with supratentorial location of ICH. We excluded patients with cerebellar or brainstem ICH as well as any patient with primary intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).\nThe study was approved by the institutional review board of the Wake Forest School of Medicine.\n\n\nExposures and Outcomes\nOur exposure was hemispheric laterality (left versus right). Our primary outcome was neurosurgical intervention as a binary variable defined as receiving a hematoma evacuation, decompressive craniectomy, or other craniotomy.\nTo explore differences in other aspects of aggressive care, we defined several secondary outcomes: receipt of external ventricular drain (EVD), receipt of tracheostomy, days of mechanical ventilation, receipt of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order at any point in the hospitalization, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) at any point in the hospitalization, and early WLST (defined as &lt; 72 from symptom onset).\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\nTo estimate the effect of hemispheric laterality on the outcomes of interest, we fitted hierarchal Bayesian regression models adjusted for the specified covariates below and study as a random intercept. This report follows suggestions from the Bayesian Analysis Reporting Guidelines12. For binary endpoints, hierarchal Bayesian logistic regression models were used. For ordinal endpoints, hierarchal Bayesian ordinal logisitic regression models were used. All analyses were performed in R version 4.4.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) using the ‘brms’ and ‘tidybayes’ packages.\n\nCovariate Selection\nWe constructed directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model our causal assumptions and to appropriately select variables to minimize confounding and selection bias. Based on our specifications, we included the following covariates in our models: age, admission Glasgow coma score (GCS), ICH location (categorized as lobar, thalamic, or basal ganglia), baseline ICH volume (measured in millilters), and presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). The DAGs used in the analyses are available in the supplementary material.\n\n\nPrior Distribution Specification\nTwo sets of priors were applied for all models, both assuming no association of hemispheric laterality on the outcomes of interest: 1) default, weakly informative priors as defined by the ‘brms’ software package; 2) priors informed from review of previous literature. A description of the reasons for these priors is available in the supplementary material.\n\n\nComputation and Description of the Posterior Distribution\nWe report the following metrics for the effect of hemispheric laterality on the primary and secondary outcomes: 1) median odds ratio (OR) of the posterior distribution with 95% credible interval; 2) probability of any difference (P[OR] &gt; 1); 3) probability of a large difference (P[OR] &gt; 1.2) as defined by the study authors; 4) percent of the posterior distribution outside of the region of practical equivalence as defined by the study authors (ROPE; 0.95 &gt; P[OR] &gt; 1.05). A description of the reasons for these thresholds is available in the supplementary material.\n\n\nMissing value policies\n\n\n\nData Availability Statement\nThe ATACH-2 (PI: Adnan I. Qureshi, MD, NCT01176565) and ERICH (PI: Daniel Woo, MD, MS, NCT01202864) data and analyses presented in this manuscript are based on the research files downloaded from the Archived Clinical Research web site of the National Institute of Neurologic Disease and Stroke (NINDS). The datasets can be obtained after approval of a written proposal as outlined on the NINDS website. As outlined in the NINDS Data Request Agreement, the analysis code is publicly available at https://github.com/nikhilpatelmd/ich-laterality."
