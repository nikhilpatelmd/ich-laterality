    "text": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a challenging disease, marked by its sudden onset, morbidity, and mortality. While ischemic stroke has garnered considerable attention and therapeutic advancements, the acute management of ICH remains limited to blood pressure control, coagulopathy reversal, and more recently surgical evacuation of hemorrhage. Overwhelmingly these efforts have focused on reducing mortality and preventing additional morbidity due to secondary injury.\nClinical presentations for patients with stroke are varied based on the hemisphere affected, where hemispheric dominance dictates cognitive processing, attention, language, and emotional responses. Consequently, when confronted with the occurrence of ICH, the specific hemisphere affected can profoundly influence not only the clinical presentation but also therapeutic strategies and prognostic outcomes.\nPrevious research involving patients with ischemic stroke provide evidence that those with right hemispheric injury present later to the hospital and may not be treated as frequently with thrombolytic therapy.1,2 It has also been noted that there is a hesitation among some practitioners to offer decompressive craniectomy in patients with left dominant-hemispheric ischemic infarcts3 despite growing literature that long-term outcomes are better for patients with left hemispheric injuries in terms of both function and health related quality of life (HRQoL).1\nIt is uncertain how the results of prior work in the ischemic stroke literature translate to patients experiencing acute ICH. We aimed to evaluate the effect of hemispheric lateralization of ICH on likelihood of receiving aggressive surgical intervention."

    "text": "Methods\n\nStudy Design and Participants\nWe conducted a cohort study using data from 2 prospective studies: the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH-2) trialqureshi_intensive_2016? and the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH)woo_ethnicracial_2013? study. ATACH-2 was a large, multicenter, international, open-label, blinded-endpoint randomized controlled trial enrolling 1000 patients with ICH while ERICH was a large, multicenter, prospective observational study enrolling patients in the United States admitted with ICH. Study protocols and results of both studies have been previously published and are available elsewhere.\nWe included all patients enrolled in these two studies with supratentorial location of ICH. We excluded patients with cerebellar or brainstem ICH as well as any patient with primary intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).\nThe study was approved by the institutional review board of the Wake Forest School of Medicine.\n\nData Availability Statement\nThe ATACH-2 (PI: Adnan I. Qureshi, MD, NCT01176565) and ERICH (PI: Daniel Woo, MD, MS, NCT01202864) data and analyses presented in this manuscript are based on the research files downloaded from the Archived Clinical Research web site of the National Institute of Neurologic Disease and Stroke (NINDS). The datasets can be obtained after approval of a written proposal as outlined on the NINDS website. As outlined in the NINDS Data Request Agreement, the analysis code is publicly available at https://github.com/nikhilpatelmd/ich-laterality.\n\n\n\nExposures and Outcomes\nOur exposure was hemispheric laterality (left versus right). Our primary outcome was neurosurgical intervention, defined as receiving a hematoma evacuation, decompressive craniectomy, or other craniotomy.\nTo explore differences in other aspects of aggressive care, we defined several secondary outcomes: receipt of external ventricular drain (EVD), tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order at any point in the hospitalization, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) at any point in the hospitalization, and early WLST (&lt; 72 from symptom onset).\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nOverall Analysis Plan"
