    "text": "Methods\n\nStudy Design and Participants\nWe conducted a cohort study using data from 2 prospective studies: the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II (ATACH-2) trial4 and the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH)5 study. ATACH-2 was a large, multicenter, international, open-label, blinded-endpoint randomized controlled trial enrolling 1000 patients with ICH while ERICH was a large, multicenter, prospective observational study enrolling patients in the United States admitted with ICH. Study protocols and results of both studies have been previously published and are available elsewhere.\nWe included all patients enrolled in these two studies with supratentorial location of ICH. We excluded patients with cerebellar or brainstem ICH as well as any patient with primary intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).\nThe study was approved by the institutional review board of the Wake Forest School of Medicine.\n\nData Availability Statement\nThe ATACH-2 (PI: Adnan I. Qureshi, MD, NCT01176565) and ERICH (PI: Daniel Woo, MD, MS, NCT01202864) data and analyses presented in this manuscript are based on the research files downloaded from the Archived Clinical Research web site of the National Institute of Neurologic Disease and Stroke (NINDS). The datasets can be obtained after approval of a written proposal as outlined on the NINDS website. As outlined in the NINDS Data Request Agreement, the analysis code is publicly available at https://github.com/nikhilpatelmd/ich-laterality.\n\n\n\nExposures and Outcomes\nOur exposure was hemispheric laterality (left versus right). Our primary outcome was neurosurgical intervention, defined as receiving a hematoma evacuation, decompressive craniectomy, or other craniotomy.\nTo explore differences in other aspects of aggressive care, we defined several secondary outcomes: receipt of external ventricular drain (EVD), tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order at any point in the hospitalization, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) at any point in the hospitalization, and early WLST (&lt; 72 from symptom onset).\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nOverall Analysis Plan"
